The 30-year-old sprinter had signalled her retirement earlier this year at the Paris Olympics after winning a gold, silver and bronze in relays to help Australia to its most successful Summer Games. ""I will definitely miss it ... It's brought me a lot of great relationships and shaped me into the person I am,"" McKeon said in the statement confirming her retirement. ""But I'm definitely ready for the next part of my life, which I'm excited for. I don't think I've had the time to reflect on everything yet."" McKeon missed out on the London Olympics as a teenager but hit her stride in Rio in 2016 where she won her first gold in the 4x100 metre relay as well as silvers in two other relays and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. In Tokyo in 2021, she won the 100m and 50m freestyle sprint titles which, along with two relay golds and three bronze medals, gave her the biggest medal haul for a single athlete at the delayed Games. ""She was and will continue to be a great role model for younger athletes,"" said Australia's swimming coach Rohan Taylor. ""She always carried herself with dignity, and while we all saw her grace – the public can not truly appreciate how tough she is."" Taylor and McKeon's uncle, Swimming Australia chief executive Rob Woodhouse, both picked out her triumph in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo, when she finished 0.31 seconds ahead of Hong Kong's Siobhan Haughey, as the highlight of her career. ""The 100m freestyle was one of the greatest races I have ever watched but I have also loved watching her advocate for those coming up through the ranks,"" said Woodhouse. As well as her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was also part of relay teams which set eight world records in the pool, three of which still stand. Reflecting on missing out on the team for the London Games, McKeon said she hoped her story would inspire young athletes to persist with their dreams. ""You have ups and you have downs. You just keep going along and you keep ticking the boxes. I can't believe where I'm at right now and how I got here,"" she added. ""I want young kids to know that I was once in the same position they are - dreaming of one day doing something big.""","sports"
"2","Brilliant Bumrah leads India to thumping win over Australia in first Test","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576203-brilliant-bumrah-leads-india-to-thumping-win-over-australia-in-first-test","PERTH: India fast bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj took three wickets apiece as the tourists hammered Australia by 295 runs in the first Test at Perth Stadium in Perth, Australia, on Monday. Australia were bowled out for 238 after tea on day four, paceman Harshit Rana wrapping up the fourth innings by clean-bowling keeper Alex Carey for 36 to secure India's 1-0 lead in the five-match series. The last time Australia won a home series after losing the opening Test was 55 years ago against West Indies. ""Fairly disappointing,"" said Australia captain Pat Cummins. ""It was just one of those games where not much went right. We didn't really give ourselves a chance in a few different facets ... so there's a few different areas we've got to clean up."" After electing to bat on a seaming first day, India were all out for 150 before fighting back to dismiss Australia for 104 courtesy of a Bumrah five-fer. Dual centurions Virat Kohli and Yashasvi Jaiswal lifted the tourists to 487-6 declared, setting a massive fourth-innings target of 534 for the hosts. Resuming day four on 12-3, the hosts quickly lost Usman Khawaja (four) after the opener mistimed Siraj (3-51) to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. Rana (1-69) bowled with fire, temporarily immobilising Steve Smith with a rib-tickler and getting Travis Head jumping as the pair added 62. Steve Smith, returning to his favoured number four position after an ill-fated opening experiment, fell caught-behind on 17 to Siraj. Head crunched boundaries aplenty on his way to his 89 but fell shy of an eighth Test ton when he edged to Pant off Bumrah (3-42), who picked up eight wickets for the match. Bumrah was captaining the side in place of Rohit Sharma, who missed the match as he recently welcomed his second child but has since rejoined the squad. ""Very happy with the beginning, we were put under pressure in the first innings but the way we responded after that, I'm really proud of the team,"" said Bumrah, who was named Player of the Match for his 8-72 over both innings. ""Obviously, this wicket was a little less spicy than the last one that I played here, but we were really well prepared. ""So I was just telling everyone to have faith in their process and ability, because over here at this moment, you have an opportunity to do something special."" Mitchell Marsh put up 47 before chopping debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy onto his stumps, and Dhrev Jurel showed off his reflexes at short-leg to catch Mitchell Starc (12) off Washington Sundar (2-48) before tea. Washington bowled his Australia spin counterpart Nathan Lyon after the break for a duck as India marched towards a welcome victory, which comes after they were humbled 3-0 at home by New Zealand earlier this month. Tailender Josh Hazlewood remained unbeaten on four. India have held the Border-Gavaskar Trophy since 2016-17. The series moves to Adelaide for the second Test starting on December 6.","sports"

"4","IPL auction records tumble as Pant, Iyer break $3m mark","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576104-ipl-auction-records-tumble-as-pant-iyer-break-3m-mark","RIYADH: Indian wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player in Indian Premier League (IPL) history Sunday when he sold for a record $3.2 million, as teams splashed out on world-class cricketers for the lucrative Twenty20 tournament. A total of 577 players are up for grabs at the two-day auction in Jeddah, with Pant, England veteran James Anderson and New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra among the top names. The 2023 record of 247.5 million rupees Kolkata paid to Australian Mitchell Starc was first breached by Punjab Kings, who the IPL said snapped up Shreyas Iyer for a ""handsome"" 267.5 million rupees ($3.17 million). Iyer, 29, captained Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL crown this year. New Punjab coach Ricky Ponting, who left Delhi Capitals after this season, said they will make Shreyas captain if he agrees. ""I have worked with him three or four years at Delhi and obviously he is a championship winning captain from last season,"" Ponting said. ""We have got someone there that can do the job if that's the way we decide to go, so I am delighted to have him back."" Shreyas' record rapidly tumbled. The IPL reported Lucknow Super Giants paid a ""gigantic"" 270 million rupees for 27-year-old star keeper Pant. ""Rishabh's history in the IPL and in the sport of cricket is unparallelled in terms of his skill, what he brings to the table,"" Lucknow owner Shashwat Goenka, said of the record buy. ""I think he came at what we had anticipated for him. We are very excited to have him as part of the squad."" Pant made an impressive return to competitive cricket in this year's IPL after a serious car crash in December 2022. He came in as captain of Delhi Capitals but he and the team parted ways. Later on day one Indian all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer hit the jackpot when he went to Kolkata for a whopping $2.81 million after a fierce bidding war with Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Venkatesh, a left-hand batter and right-arm medium pace bowler who was released by Kolkata only to be bought back, became the third-highest buy of the day. The auction started on a sizzling note when Indian quick Arshdeep Singh began a bidding war, which ended with Punjab getting the left-arm pace bowler for $2.13 million. This year, Australian left-arm quick Starc was not retained by Kolkata — and went to Delhi for $1.39 million. Fellow quick Josh Hazlewood went for $1.48 million to Bengaluru, while England fast bowler Jofra Archer cost the same amount for the Rajasthan Royals. New Zealand quick Trent Boult returned to five-time winners Mumbai Indians for $1.48 million. Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad had a big pay day as he went to five-time champions Chennai Super Kings for $1.18 million. Gujarat Titans paid $1.87 million for England white-ball skipper Jos Buttler, while India pace bowler Mohammed Shami went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for $1.18 million. Australian David Warner and England's Jonny Bairstow went unsold, but could be brought back later in the auction. The IPL has generated billions in revenue since its inception in 2008, turning the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) into one of the richest governing bodies in sport. In June 2022 it sold the broadcast rights for five IPL seasons to global media giants for $6.2 billion. The BCCI has sought to broaden the tournament's profile by staging the auction abroad. Last year it was held in Dubai, a regular host for international cricket tournaments. Like Saudi Arabia, it has a large base of prospective fans among its migrant worker population. Putting the auction on in Jeddah is seen as a win-win for a tournament expanding its global reach and a kingdom using sports to improve its image. The IPL is a huge earner for Indian cricket and the tournament makes more than $11 billion for the economy each year. The pioneering IPL helped make Twenty20 cricket hugely popular, spawning copycat events worldwide. Dates for next year's IPL have not been released but seasons usually run from March to May.","sports"

The hosts had posted a total of 206 runs after they were bundled out by the Green Shirts in 40.2 overs. Beginning their chase, Pakistan lost wickets in rapid succession taking them to 60/6 in the 21st over of the second innings. The match was then stopped due to rain and later called off, resulting in Zimbabwe to lead ODI series by 1-0. Earlier, Pakistan had won the toss and invited Zimbabwe to bat first. National side spinners — vice captain Salman Ali Agha and debutant Faisal Akram — destroyed Zimbabwe batting lineup for a modest total. Both took three wickets apiece. Aamir Jamal (42/1) and Mohammad Hasnain (43/1) turned out to be the most expensive bowlers for the Green Shirts. Zimbabwe’s Joylord Gumbie (15) got run out in sixth over, then his successor Dion Myers (8) was caught off Agha in 10th. Tadiwanashe Marumani made (29 off 44) before departing on Agha’s ball. Captain Craig Ervine (6 off 12) failed to impress with the bat as Saim Ayub caught him off Haris Rauf. Then Brandon Mavuta (1) was routed by Jamal and Brian Bennett (20) by Faisal. Lower middle order batsman Sikandar Raza (39 off 56) and tail-ender Richard Ngarava (48 off 52) put up modest resistance before Pakistan concluded the innings with opponents’ all out.

The 25-year-old was also not called up for France during the international break despite being the team captain but Ancelotti said Mbappe was in good spirits in training sessions ahead of Sunday's LaLiga trip to Leganes. ""It happens to all great strikers, he can get frustrated but that's not his case. I see him motivated and happy to train with his teammates,"" Ancelotti told reporters on Saturday. ""Sooner or later he will break that streak of games in which he hasn't scored goals. Tomorrow he will have a great game because it is just a matter of time. ""He has incredible quality and sooner or later he will show it."" Mbappe's position has been debated since his dream move to the Santiago Bernabeu, with many wondering if he should play on the left but Ancelotti has been reluctant to switch Vinicius Jr, their top scorer who plays in the same position. ""I don't think Kylian has ever asked me for a position on the pitch, everyone wants to start in the starting 11,"" Ancelotti said. ""But Mbappe and Vinicius don't have a fixed position on the pitch. It all depends on the match."" Ancelotti also said he did not need to give Mbappe any specific instructions in training but the Italian has been working with defenders Raul Asencio and Ferland Mendy as he deals with an injury crisis at the back. Although David Alaba is on the mend from an anterior cruciate ligament tear, Real have lost Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao to similar injuries. ""We have focused on defence, with Raul Asencio, Mendy, trying out right backs,"" Ancelotti said. With the opportunity to sign reinforcements in the mid-season transfer window, Ancelotti said Real would consider their options after playing Sevilla next month in their last match of 2024.","sports"

The jury of eight women and four men reached its verdict in the civil trial at Ireland's high court after six hours and 10 minutes of deliberation. The plaintiff, Nikita Hand, alleged that McGregor sexually assaulted her on December 9, 2018, and that another man, James Lawrence, did the same, the court heard during two weeks of evidence. The jury found that Lawrence did not assault Hand. McGregor left the court through a large scrum of reporters without commenting and later posted on X that he planned to appeal the decision. McGregor, 36, denied the allegation and said he had ""fully consensual sex"" with Hand. He also denied causing bruising to the plaintiff. Hand's lawyer told the jury that when she was referred to a sexual assault treatment unit the day after the alleged assault, a doctor was so concerned that he directed that photographs be taken of her injuries. Hand said that she and a friend made contact with McGregor, who she knew, after a work Christmas party. She said they were driven by McGregor to a party in a penthouse room of a south Dublin hotel where drugs and alcohol were consumed. She said McGregor took her into a bedroom in the penthouse and sexually assaulted her. Speaking outside the court, Hand said she was overwhelmed by the support she had received and that she felt vindicated. ""To all the victims of sexual assault, I hope my story is a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be, speak up, you have a voice and keep on fighting for justice,"" she said.","sports"

The famed footballer joined the La Masia academy as a 13-year-old and kick-started his journey. He had growth problems but went on to make his senior debut against Espanyol in 2004 aged 17. Messi went on to become the club’s greatest player and one of the best footballers of all time withGoal.comreporting that the athlete scored 672 goals for Barca in the 17 years he represented the side. His time with Barcelona ended in 2021 after the Catalan side’s financial troubles began to become impossible to handle and the club failed to renew the contract of the Argentine maestro despite President Joan Laporta promising him otherwise. This left a strain between the two. However, Laporta is trying to look past the differences and has invited Messi personally to attend his former club’s 125th anniversary at the Liceu Theatre on November 29, according toCatalunya Radio's Tot Costa. The reports suggest that the World Cup winner will attend the event and aims to return to the club for the first time since he bid farewell to it in 2021.","sports"

Nazir had been severely ill and undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Punjab's capital city since last week  before his unfortunate demise. The Lahore-born cricketer was seriously injured five years ago after he faced a traffic accident which caused his health to deteriorate. The right-handed cricketer, who represented Pakistan in 14 Test matches and four ODIs, took 34 wickets throughout his international career. He claimed seven wickets in the first innings of his debut Test — the first Pakistani spinner to achieve the feat. He then pursued a career in umpiring and officiated 15 ODIs and five Tests during a brief stint. Nazir Junior was revered for his cricketing acumen and contributions towards nurturing raw talent. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and the cricketing fraternity expressed deep sorrow and grief over the sad demise of the former cricketer and umpire. Naqvi paid rich tributes to Nazir Junior’s services to Pakistan cricket. ""On behalf of the PCB, I express my condolences and grief over the demise of our former Test Cricketer Mohammad Nazir,"" he said in a statement. ""We extend our deepest sympathies and share the grief of his friends and family. His contributions to Pakistan cricket will always be remembered.""","sports"

According to Indian media, the minister stated that the match would be held under the supervision of the state government. ""All the financial assistance for organising this high-profile football event will be provided by the merchants of the state. Argentina’s national team is coming here,"" he said. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has also announced the expected visit of Lionel Messi-led Argentina next year. “Kerala is set to make history as FIFA World Cup champions Argentina are expected to visit next year! The dream is becoming a reality thanks to the state government’s efforts and the support of the Argentina National Football team. Let's gear up to welcome the champions and celebrate our love for football,” Vijayan said in a post on social media platform X. The last time Messi-led Argentina visited India was in 2011, when the team faced Venezuela at the Salt Lake Stadium in a friendly fixture in Kolkata. The game ended in a 0-0 draw. The megastar has an incredible fan following in India, a country that is extremely enthusiastic about cricket. As for the player's future, he has yet to hang up his boots in international football as he continues to be a major part of the Argentina football team in the World Cup qualifiers for the 2028 edition.

The former captain, who has been going through a tough patch across all formats of the game, also had an unimpressive run in the recent three-match T20I series against Australia where he only scored 47 runs at a meagre average of 15.66 and strike-rate of 142.42. Aqib while addressing the media in Lahore on Wednesday, was asked whether Babar would be considered for T20Is. “Senior players like Babar and Rizwan have a value. They performed over the years for Pakistan,"" he said. Earlier, commenting on Babar’s woes in the aforementioned series, former cricketer Basit Ali had claimed that the third T20I against Australia was the batter’s last in the format, since Aqib — one of the most vocal critiques of star batter — had taken the reins of the white-ball side. “As long as Aqib Javed is the head coach, this may be Babar Azam’s last T20 match,” Basit had said during a local TV programme. “I am simply stating what is evident. You have a premium batsman averaging just 14 runs across three matches. What kind of batsman gets dismissed before the eighth over?” he had questioned. However, Aqib in his address debunked Basit’s claim and highlighted Babar's contributions to the team over the years and reiterated that ""every person has its own opinion but our focus is not to target any individual"". “Everyone saw Babar playing in the last three ODIs. I mean, look, when you become a coach or a selector, then it’s not about individual [preference]. Your goal is to improve Pakistan cricket,"" the head coach added. “Whatever efforts we put in did not favour any individual but Pakistan cricket as a whole. If you won the series against England it was won by Pakistan cricket,"" Aqib said while addressing the media. “So, our focus remains solely to try and improve the image and results of Pakistan cricket,"" he concluded.","sports"
"17","With ICC in a fix, Champions Trophy schedule 'likely to be delayed'","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575285-with-icc-in-a-fix-champions-trophy-schedule-likely-to-be-delayed","LAHORE: The ambiguity surrounding the International Cricket Council's (ICC) Champions Trophy 2025 is expected to linger on due to the likelihood of a delay in the announcement of the schedule for the mega-event, sources toldGeo Newson Wednesday. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the sources added, was not backing from its stance against a hybrid model for the tournament and therefore it is unlikely that the event's schedule will be announced in the next 24 hours. The development comes as the highly-anticipated tournament — set to be hosted by Pakistan in February-March next year — has seen the PCB coming at odds with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the latter's apparent refusal to visit Pakistan.   The ICC has officially demanded a written explanation from the BCCI over its refusal after the PCB requested the ICC to provide a copy of India's written response regarding the decision against attending the mega-event. The Indian board had previously verbally communicated its decision against its participation to the international cricketing body. Apart from the PCB's stance, the refusal of broadcasters and commercial partners to accept a schedule that does not feature a Pakistan-India match — which brings significant eyes and therefore generates valuable revenue — has also added to the ICC's woes. Furthermore, they also have warned of legal action if the tournament does not include a contest between the arch-rivals. The sources say that the announcement of the schedule will be possible in a couple of days if the stakeholders show flexibility. Stakeholders are in favour of holding the event with mutual consensus, they added. Meanwhile, the international cricketing body is striving to come up with a solution before BCCI Secretary Jay Shah takes charge as ICC Chairman on December 1. It is pertinent to mention that in recent years, the ICC has made sure that India play Pakistan at least once in each of the global cricketing events, ensuring a major chunk of revenue from this game. The match between arch-rivals at the 2023 World Cup drew unprecedented interest, with 173 million viewers on Indian TV and 225 million digital viewers. The ICC, which secured $3.2 billion from broadcast rights for the 2024-2027 cycle and anticipates $1 billion more in other revenue, relies heavily on marquee events featuring Pakistan and India. It is to be noted that India has not played an international match in Pakistan since 2008. Last year, the BCCI declined to send a team to Pakistan for the Asia Cup, leading to a hybrid format with later stages held in Sri Lanka. However, Pakistan did visit India soon after for the 2023 ODI World Cup.","sports"

The match marked the 38-year-old’s final professional appearance, bringing an end to his illustrious career. Nadal, overwhelmed with emotions, delivered a moving 15-minute speech at a sold-out Malaga venue. The 22-time Grand Slam champion struggled to hold back tears as he recalled his journey. ""What I have tried to do is to be a good person, and I hope you’ve seen that,"" Nadal told the crowd. “I leave the tennis world having met so many friends along the way. I have so many people to thank. I leave with the peace of mind of having left a sporting and personal legacy I can be proud about. “Thanks to all of you, the public. It's over 20 years (career), good years, bad years. I have been able to live with all of you. I have felt very fortunate to feel so much affection from all over the world, especially here in Spain.” Earlier, Nadal’s singles match ended in a 6-4, 6-4 loss to Botic van de Zandschulp, breaking his 29-match Davis Cup singles winning streak. Despite Carlos Alcaraz’s victory over Tallon Griekspoor, Spain’s hopes ended when Marcel Granollers and Alcaraz were defeated in the deciding doubles match. Nadal, who announced his retirement last month, admitted his farewell did not unfold as he had hoped. “It's obvious that it didn't turn out the way we wanted it to. I have given what I had. I want to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to spend these last days as a professional team player,” Nadal said. ""My body has told me it doesn't want to play tennis anymore and I have to accept that. I am privileged. I have been able to make my hobbies my profession. I am fortunate. “My family, my team, my friends. I am a person who believes in continuity, I believe in keeping the people you love and who make your life better. I have kept my family close. Without you this would not have been possible.""

However, we haven’t got any official letter yet but on the basis of our conversation with MEA we’ve decided not to go to Pakistan and we will not participate in the Blind T20 World Cup.” He expressed disappointment over the decision but affirmed that the cricketing association would abide by the MEA’s directives. ""Along with us, England, Australia and New Zealand are also not coming. Hence, India will become the fourth team which will not take part in this tournament,” he claimed. Despite India’s refusal, the Blind T20 World Cup 2024 will proceed as per the schedule. ""All other teams are coming to Pakistan for the World Cup. If one team doesn’t show up, it won’t affect our preparations,"" Pakistan Blind Cricket Council (PBCC) chairman Syed Sultan Shah had stated.

According to the details, the cricket board is considering Javed for the role, with the upcoming white-ball series against Zimbabwe most likely being his first assignment as the Pakistan head coach. Considering the white-ball team's packed schedule – commencing with white-ball matches against Zimbabwe, comprising three ODIs and three T20Is from 24 November to December 5 — a decision in this regard is expected soon, sources further revealed. Javed emerged as the frontrunner due to his vast coaching experience, bolstered by his successful stints with domestic teams and franchise cricket. The development came in the wake of Gary Kirsten's untimely resignation from the role, just days before the team’s departure to Australia. As a result, the PCB roped in Gillespie for the role on an interim basis for the ongoing Australia tour. Gillespie had rested the rumours by expressing his disinterest in assuming the role on a full-time basis. ""I've only taken over white-ball format coaching on an interim basis. I am not keen on coaching permanently in the white ball format at the moment,"" Gillespie told Australian media in Melbourne. ""I did not apply for the full-time white-ball coaching."" ""I love coaching, but I don’t believe I can spend 11 months away from home. I also don’t think I could mentally handle it,"" he stated, highlighting his need to spend ample time with his family.","sports"

According to the details, the national team arrived here today afternoon as they look to avoid the series whitewash by securing a consolation victory in the last fixture, scheduled here at Bellerive Oval on Monday. The touring side, who registered a historic victory in the three-match ODI series, failed to deliver a similar performance in the ongoing T20I series. Pakistan were blown away in the rain-reduced opening fixture on Thursday before succumbing to a narrow 13-run defeat in the second T20I in Sydney, which saw them dropping multiple catches. During the post-match presentation, Pakistan captain Rizwan said dropping catches at crucial stages of the game hurt the touring side, highlighting the difficulty of taking 16 wickets – due to drop catches – against a strong team like Australia. ""If you drop crucial catches at crucial times, it will cost you always. Australia in Australia isn't an easy team. If you give them chances like that and you have to get 16 wickets (due to the drops), it won't be easy for any team,” said Rizwan. The right-handed batter, who scored a scratchy 16 from 26 deliveries in the 148-run pursuit, also labelled the pitch difficult to bat on. “We all know that the pitch wasn't easy to bat on, so the catches were crucial,"" he added.

"31","End of an era as Nadal aims for winning Davis Cup farewell","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574834-end-of-an-era-as-nadal-aims-for-winning-davis-cup-farewell","Spanish superstar Rafael Nadal is aiming to cap his emotional farewell from tennis with another Davis Cup triumph in Malaga next week. Nadal, 38, has battled injuries over the past few years and the extent to which he can compete for his country is unknown, but all eyes will be on the 22-time Grand Slam winner. The veteran led Spain to victory in Madrid five years ago — the last time they won the trophy and Nadal's fourth. However, he admitted Saturday that his role in Malaga may be limited to doubles rather than singles. ""First off, we'll have to see how I feel in training and, if I really don't feel I have a chance to win the singles, I'll be the first to not want to play,"" Nadal said in comments to the Spanish Tennis Federation (RFET). ""If I don't feel ready, I'll be the first to speak to the captain (David Ferrer). I've already told him on a few occasions not to make any decisions based on the fact that it's my last week as a professional tennis player."" French Open and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz will be Spain's leading player and his presence offers Nadal a real chance of retiring on a high note. ""Probably one of the most special tournaments that I'm going to play. Last tournament of Rafa, I'll be able to be next to him in the last moments on a tennis court for him,"" said Alcaraz who played alongside Nadal in doubles at the Olympics in Paris this year. ""I think it's most important for Rafa, for his last tournament. I really want him to retire with a title. It's going to be really, really emotional and a really special tournament for me."" Representing Spain, Nadal won singles gold at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and triumphed in the doubles at Rio 2016 alongside Marc Lopez. But former world number one Nadal's injury setbacks in the twilight of his career have seen his ranking slump to 155. The last of his 92 career titles came with his 14th French Open and 22nd major at Roland Garros in 2022. He hasn't played a competitive singles match since losing to Novak Djokovic at the Olympics in July while in 2023 he played just four times. Many are hoping for Spain and Alcaraz to meet world number one Jannik Sinner's Italy, the defending champions, in the final, as the two young stars continue to build on a gripping rivalry. Record 32-time champions the United States have selected a strong team spearheaded by US Open finalist Taylor Fritz and are also among the most likely contenders. Nadal clashed with Alcaraz in Saudi Arabia at the ""Six Kings Slam"" exhibition in October, losing in straight sets, but they will be fighting for the same goal in Andalucia. The start of the Billie Jean King Cup was delayed because of a weather alert in the Malaga region, in the wake of devastating floods in the east of Spain. Alcaraz, ranked third in the world, said the flooding in Valencia increased his motivation to help his country triumph. ""I'm here to give my grain of sand because playing for Spain is the biggest thing that there is for me,"" he continued. Tennis greats and stars from other sports are among those clamouring to watch Nadal's farewell, with career rivals Djokovic and Roger Federer among those expected to attend. Spain face the Netherlands on Tuesday in the last eight, with the winner taking on Germany or Canada in the semi-finals. Italy ended a 47-year wait to win the Davis Cup again a year ago as they beat Australia in the final with Sinner as their key player and are favourites to defend their title. The Australian Open and US Open winner is still waiting for an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency against him to be resolved. Sinner twice tested positive for traces of an anabolic steroid in March but the International Tennis Integrity Agency cleared him of blame in August. Italy face Argentina in the quarter-finals with the winner taking on the United States or Australia. Captained by Lleyton Hewitt, Australia were runners-up last year and are second only to the US in Davis Cup triumphs, winning the title 28 times. The final takes place next Sunday with all matches held at the indoor hard-court Martin Carpena arena.","sports"

The 37-year-old American looked fully in control throughout the main event at Madison Square Garden, preventing his opponent from leveraging his boxing skills and finishing with a brutal heel to the body that left Miocic on the canvas clutching his ribs. ""That body shot man, no matter how tough you are, the liver's the liver,"" a jubilant Jones said in the cage following his victory.  A post shared by UFC (@ufc)  After a cautious opening minute, former light heavyweight champ Jones took Miocic down with a superbly timed trip and trapped him before raining down elbows as he dominated the rest of the round. Keen not to get taken down again, Miocic was hesitant as he tried to manage the distance, but Jones was able to measure strikes to the body from his southpaw stance to keep Miocic on the back foot. Croatian-American Miocic enjoyed some success early in the third round, but once again Jones was able to work out the puzzle, connecting with a couple of punches late in the round before his creative rotating kick ended the bout.  A post shared by Dana White (@danawhite)  With US President-elect Donald Trump in the audience, Jones then imitated the president-elect's campaign-trail dance as he celebrated. In the aftermath, 42-year-old former champion Miocic said he was retiring from the sport. In the co-main event, Brazil's Charles Oliveira defeated Michael Chandler by unanimous decision to put his name back in contention for a crack at the lightweight title he was stripped of for missing weight in May 2022.","sports"

Tyson was beaten by unanimous decision on Friday at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, with fans largely disappointed as the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion showed his age and was never able to generate any offence against his younger opponent. Initially set for July, the fight was pushed back after Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up. ""This is one of those situations when you lost but still won. I'm grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time,"" Tyson wrote in a post on X. ""I almost died in June. Had eight blood transfusions.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is reportedly considering him for the role in the upcoming matches against Zimbabwe and beyond, as per the insiders. A decision in this regard is expected soon, they added. This development comes in the wake of Gary Kirsten’s resignation as head coach ahead of the ongoing Australia tour, which created a significant gap in the coaching structure. In Kirsten’s absence, red ball Head Coach Jason Gillespie was appointed as interim coach for the limited-overs matches down under. Javed, who is currently serving as a member of PCB’s selection committee, has emerged as the leading candidate due to his extensive coaching experience, including successful stints with domestic teams and franchise cricket. His expertise and familiarity with Pakistan’s cricketing structure make him a strong choice as the team prepares for an intense international schedule. Pakistan’s packed cricket schedule includes white-ball matches against Zimbabwe comprising three ODIs and three T20Is from 24 November to 5 December. This will be followed by three-match T20I and ODI series and two Test matches against South Africa from 10 December to 7 January. Kirsten’s departure earlier this month was reportedly due to differences with the PCB over various issues. He was unwilling to stay in Pakistan as required by his contract and preferred to join the team only shortly before series or tours. He had also failed to ensure his availability during and after the Champions Cup despite being reminded of his mandatory availability for 11 months as required by his contract with the board. Kirsten further insisted on influencing central contract categories. He even threatened to withdraw from the Australia tour unless the PCB addressed the contract issues of mental performance coach David Reid. The PCB’s decision to restructure the selection committee also became a point of contention. The revamped committee no longer includes head coaches or the team captain. The five-member panel comprises Javed, Aleem Dar, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, and Hassan Cheema.","sports"

According to the PCB, Chairman Naqvi, accompanied by Salman Naseer, met the ECB chair on Friday amid the ongoing ambiguity surrounding the eight-team mega tournament. “England's recent tour of Pakistan was very impressive.

Set to chase 148, Pakistan only managed 134 before being bundled out in the final over. The visitors had a shaky start to the run chase as they lost star batter Babar Azam (three) and Sahibzada Farhan (five) inside three overs with just 17 runs on the board. Skipper Mohammad Rizwan then joined hands with Usman Khan and launched recovery. The duo, however, could add 27 runs to the total before Spencer Johson removed Rizwan in the 10th over, which also saw the dismissal of Salman Ali Agha (0). Rizwan scored a scratchy 16 off 26 deliveries. Coming out to bat at number 6 with the touring side reeling at 44/4 in 9.3 overs, Muhammad Irfan Khan registered a solid partnership with Usman and took the total past the 100-run mark. The 58-run partnership had put Pakistan in a comfortable position but Usman's untimely dismissal, followed by the three quick wickets, halted their progress. Irfan fought valiantly until the final over but his efforts were not enough to steer his side over the line. Usman remained the top-scorer for Pakistan with a gutsy 52 off 38 deliveries, laced with five boundaries including a six, followed by Irfan, who scored an unbeaten with a 28-ball 37, featuring as many boundaries. Johnson was the standout bowler for Australia, courtesy of his five-wicket haul. He was followed by Adam Zampa, who bagged two wickets. Opting to bat first, Australian openers Jake Fraser-McGurk and Matthew Short came out all guns blazing and smashed Pakistan pacers for 48 runs in the first three overs. After a dismal start with the ball, Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan’s decision to introduce Haris Rauf proved beneficial as the right-arm speedster struck twice in his first over, dismissing Fraser-McGurk and skipper Josh Inglis (0). Fraser-McGurk scored 20 off just nine deliveries with the help of three fours and a six. His opening partner Short, on the other hand, perished in the next over as Abbas Afridi reduced Australia to 56/3 in five overs. Short remained the top-scorer for Australia with a 17-ball 32, laced with two fours and as many sixes. Following the triple blow, all-rounders Marcus Stoinis (14) and Glenn Maxwell (21) looked to anchor the innings with a 30-run partnership for the fourth wicket but their efforts were quashed by Sufiyan Muqeem, who removed both batters in his successive overs. Haris continued to unsettle Australia as the right-arm pacer bagged two more wickets — Tim David (18) and Xavier Bartlett (five) — and registered magnificent match figures of 4/22 in his quota of four overs. Young pacer Abbas bowled an exceptional final over as he conceded only six runs and took two wickets to further dent Australia’s chances of posting a commendable total. Abbas returned brilliant figures of 3/17 in his four overs, while Sufiyan claimed two wickets. The third and final match takes place in Hobart on Monday. Pakistan won the preceding one-day international (ODI) series 2-1 before a 29-run defeat in the rain-shortened T20 series opener.

In front of a crowd of 72,300 at AT&T Stadium, Paul dominated much of the bout against Tyson, earning a unanimous decision victory and becoming only the sixth fighter to defeat the former heavyweight champion. The bout between the 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prizefighter and the 58-year-old ex-heavyweight champion was streamed live on Netflix. The win boosts Jake Paul's professional record to 11-1, with seven knockouts, solidifying his position as a credible contender in boxing. The fans were left largely disappointed as Tyson — given his age — was never able to generate any offence against his younger opponent and landed just 18 punches against Paul's 78. ""First and foremost, Mike Tyson — it's an honor to be able to fight him,"" said Paul. ""It was as tough and hard as I thought it would be."" He said the former champion was an icon and it was an honour for him to fight him. ""He’s the G.O.A.T. I look up to him, I’m inspired by him, and we wouldn’t be here today without him."" Tyson, who wore a knee brace, never mounted much of a challenge after being wobbled by some left hands in the third round, but did enough defending to avoid taking any serious damage. He admitted after the contest to fighting through a leg injury. ""Yeah, but I can't use that as an excuse. If I did, I wouldn't be in here,"" Tyson said. ""I knew he was a good fighter. He was prepared, I came to fight. I didn't prove nothing to anybody, only to myself. I'm not one of those guys that live to please the world. I'm just happy with what I can do."" Tyson, one of the most fearsome heavyweight champions of all time during his heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s, was in his first professional fight in nearly 20 years. He was non-committal when asked if he would return to the ring again. ""I don't know. It depends on the situation,"" he said. Paul (11-1) said he can now fight anyone he wants, possibly even Mexican Canelo Alvarez, after being the main attraction in the mega event that brought out a star-studded crowd and 72,300 fight fans to the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys.

In a letter issued on Friday, the PSB called for a comprehensive and detailed response to the issues raised in its initial letter dated November 11, 2024. The NC had replied on November 13, but the board said the response failed to address specific queries and instead focused on generalisations. The PSB, in its earlier communication, had raised serious concerns about procedural irregularities. These included the delay in notifying successful candidates for the Provincial Football Associations before convening the Congress meeting, the NC Chairman's use of the title ""President, PFF"" instead of the Fifa-assigned designation of ""Chairman, NC,"" and the lack of a FIFA authorisation letter for proposed amendments to the PFF constitution. The board emphasised that such actions appeared to exceed the scope of the NC's mandate, calling for clarity on these matters. In its four-page reply, the NC largely highlighted its achievements since its appointment and insisted on its autonomy, suggesting that the PSB had been misled by individuals with vested interests. However, the PSB rejected these arguments, stating that the sequence of events has validated its concerns. It pointed out that the Congress meeting notice was issued on November 5, 2024, while the notifications for Provincial Association elections were delayed until November 13, 2024 — only after PSB intervention. This delay, the PSB noted, substantiated its apprehensions about procedural lapses. The board further criticised the NC Chairman's use of the title ""President, PFF,"" describing it as inconsistent with Fifa's mandate, which explicitly designates the role as ""Chairman, NC"". The country's sports board argued that such actions undermined transparency and governance, which are core principles of responsible sports management. While reiterating its support for the autonomy of sports organisations, the PSB stressed that autonomy must be exercised responsibly and in accordance with organisational statutes and mandates. It highlighted the International Olympic Committee's Olympic Agenda 2020, which emphasises that autonomy entails both rights and responsibilities. The board stated that autonomy cannot be a shield for actions that compromise transparency, fairness, or constitutional governance. ""As per the IOC's Olympic Agenda 2020, autonomy must be exercised responsibly, adhering to organisational statutes and mandates. Autonomy does not permit actions that undermine transparency, fairness, or constitutional governance,"" the letter reads. The PSB has also informed the NC Chairman Haroon Malik that the National Assembly Standing Committee on Inter-Provincial Coordination has scheduled a meeting on November 19, 2024, in Islamabad. The PFF has been invited to present a detailed report on the election process during the upcoming session. The PSB concluded its letter by reiterating the need for a detailed and substantive response to the issues raised in the initial correspondence, emphasising that this was essential for addressing the legitimate concerns of Pakistan's football community and ensuring compliance with Fifa's mandate. ""Finally, we reiterate our request for a detailed and substantive response to the queries raised in our letter dated 11th November 2024. This is essential for addressing the legitimate concerns of Pakistan's football community and ensuring adherence to Fifa's mandate,"" the PSB said.","sports"

Argentina took the lead 11 minutes into the game when Enzo Fernandez's deep pass found Lautaro Martinez, whose thunderous shot was initially ruled out for offside, but was eventually awarded after a VAR review. Paraguay went close moments later when Gustavo Gomez's header from a corner hit the crossbar. The home side quickly tried again with Gustavo Velazquez's cross finding Sanabria, who unleashed a superb overhead kick that left goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez helpless. The shocked visitors struggled to find their feet, with Messi, 36, largely absent from the action for much of the first half and only managing one shot that went wide. However, he was twice fouled by Alderete, but referee Anderson Daroco didn't show him a second yellow card before the break. ""I think, overall, we played a great game. We controlled the ball. Their goals came from two of our mistakes. We need to fix our lapses on set pieces,"" striker Martinez said after the match to TyC sports. ""The (goal) at the start of the second half made everything more difficult. We have to congratulate the opponent, who defended very well,"" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni told a press conference. World Cup holders Argentina top the standings with 22 points from 11 games and will host ninth-placed Peru on Tuesday. Paraguay are sixth on 16 points, behind on goal difference to Ecuador, who hammered Bolivia 4-0 on Thursday, and Uruguay, who host second-placed Colombia on Friday. Earlier, Brazil were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela, leaving them in third place on 17 points.

The development follows the BCCI verbally informing the ICC of its decision not to travel to Pakistan for the mega-event, after which the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) requested the ICC to provide a copy of India’s written response in this regard, the sources added. They said that, as per the rules, the Indian board would have to provide solid grounds for not playing the tournament in the country. “In case of receiving a written reply, Pakistan may seek substantial evidence supporting the reasons,” they said, adding that the ICC would then have to take a final decision about India after reviewing those reasons. Scheduling of the Champions Trophy, one of the most important cricketing events after the World Cup, hit a snag after India refused to play the Champions Trophy 2025 in Pakistan. According to sources, the ICC last week informed the PCB that India would not tour Pakistan for the eight-team tournament. Pakistan has rejected the option of a hybrid arrangement that would allow India to play their matches at neutral venues, such as in the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, the PCB wrote to the sport’s governing body seeking an explanation for India’s refusal to send a team to the country for the mega cricket event. Sources privy to the development said that if the Indian cricket body failed to provide proper reasons, then the Indian team would be asked to participate in the cricketing event in Pakistan. If, for any reason, India refuses to play in Pakistan without valid reasons, another team may replace them in the Champions Trophy, they added. As the ICC earns from the trophy's broadcast rights, advertisements, and sponsorships, India’s non-participation may deal it a financial blow of $500 million, while the Indian board is estimated to lose $100 million in revenues, according to the sources.","sports"

Ahead of this crucial clash at the Estadio do Dragao in Lisbon, the 39-year-old captain of Portugal shared an inspiring message on his social media, emphasising the importance of teamwork and focus. Taking to his Instagram, the Al Nassr striker posted a series of photos in which he can be seen smiling and practicing with his teammates. ""Focused on the win!"" he captioned the post. A post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) Portugal's head coach Roberto Martinez faced disappointment at Euro 2024 as his squad's promising campaign ended in a penalty shootout defeat to France in the quarter-finals. Despite this setback, Portugal have rebounded impressively, winning three of their four matches in the UEFA Nations League with Ronaldo scoring in all three games. Consequently, the five-time Ballon d'Or award winner is likely to lead Portugal's attacking unit on Friday even after a goal-less Euro 2024 campaign. On the other hand, Poland failed to secure a single victory at Euro 2024, pickin up their only point against France as they crashed out in the group stages. Additionally, Poland are without a win in their last three games, including a disappointing 3-1 defeat when they hosted Portugal. The Poles have failed to win any of their last five head-to-heads against this opponent.","sports"
"44","Pak-India relations: US says sports is potent, connecting force","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574445-pak-ind-relations-us-says-sports-is-certainly-potent-connecting-force","WASHINGTON: Against the backdrop of India’s refusing to tour Pakistan to participate in the Champions Trophy 2025, the United States has stressed adopting sports diplomacy as it ""connects people"". US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel stated this responding to a query about Pakistan-India relations' affecting the big sports event. ""…sports is certainly a potent and connecting force. This department really prioritises the role that sports diplomacy has in connecting people. It is something that I know is incredibly important to the US State Department,"" he said. The cricket world is is currently facing a dilemma regarding scheduling of the Champions Trophy, one of the most important cricketing event after the World Cup. Patel was of the view that at the end of the day, sports connected so many people, and it was a great way for human-to-human and people-to-people ties that the US administration had really prioritised. Patel also said since it was something between India and Pakistan so it was certainly for them to speak, whether it be through sports or other means. “I will let them speak to their own bilateral relationship. Certainly not something for us to get in the middle of…,” he maintained. The development comes after India refused to play Champions Trophy tournament in Pakistan next year. The International Cricket Council (ICC) informed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) last week that India would not tour Pakistan for the eight-team tournament, sources had said, leaving the fate of the event hanging in the balance. Pakistan had previously rejected the option of a hybrid arrangement that would allow India to play their matches at neutral venues, for example in the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, the PCB has asked the sport's governing body to explain India's refusal to send a team to the country for the mega cricket event. The board intends to present a firm stance, reflecting the government's advisory, and has decided to not accept any ""hybrid model"" provisioning any of its Champions Trophy matches outside Pakistan. ""If India's participation contributes to ICC’s revenue, the PCB’s role is equally crucial, and without Pakistan-India matches, the ICC revenues would suffer significantly,"" say sources. Also, there's a chance of Pakistan boycotting ICC events in India altogether for ""mixing sports with politics"" and refusing to visit Pakistan. The prospective move, if executed, could have major financial and structural consequences for global cricket as Pakistan's absence could weaken viewership and ICC’s projected revenue from broadcasters and sponsors. The ICC, which secured $3.2 billion from broadcast rights for the 2024-2027 cycle and anticipates $1 billion more in other revenue, relies heavily on marquee events featuring Pakistan and India, which consistently attract record viewership and engagement. “No India vs Pakistan games in ICC events mean all broadcast and sponsorship deals would fall out,” said a source who noted that a match in the ICC event is important for global cricket. In recent years, the ICC has made sure that India play Pakistan at least once in each of the global cricketing events, ensuring a major chunk of revenue from this game. The match between arch-rivals at the 2023 World Cup drew unprecedented interest, with 173 million viewers on Indian TV and 225 million digital viewers. It is to be noted that India has not played an international match in Pakistan since 2008. Last year, the BCCI declined to send a team to Pakistan for the Asia Cup, leading to a hybrid format with later stages held in Sri Lanka. However, Pakistan did visit India soon after for the 2023 ODI World Cup, where they fell short of reaching the semi-finals. To another query, the State Department spokesperson said the US condemned the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) Majeed Brigade’s November 9 bombing at a railway station. He also extended condolences to the victims and their families. ""We have a shared interest in combating these kinds of threats with Pakistan. We have a shared commitment to regional security. The US itself has designated the BLA as a specially designated global terrorist organisation. We did that back in 2019. And at the end of the day, we're going to continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism and violent extremism,"" he added. In response to a question about restrictions on internet usage including social media platform X in Pakistan, he said internet freedom was something that the US would continue to raise around the world.","sports"

India beat South Africa in the final to win the tournament, which was co-hosted by the US and West Indies in June. The World Cricketers' Association (WCA) said in a statement on Wednesday that some cases of non-payment of the prize money have been paired with ""threatening and intimidatory behaviour"" by national governing bodies to player groups. A source told Reuters that the ICC has taken up the issue with five boards of the 20 participating countries to ensure players were paid in a timely manner. Earlier, WCA CEO Tom Moffat said the global players' body was ""extremely concerned... with a number of threats made against players who stand up for themselves and their colleagues in some cricket environments."" ""We appreciate the ICC's efforts to date in ensuring the players involved are paid in full and are certain the ICC will continue to take all appropriate steps against any Boards who do not do so and to enforce their terms of participation,"" Moffat said in the statement. ""Every player in our sport should receive the benefits they are entitled to in full, and should be provided with a safe environment to play, work, and advocate for themselves and their colleagues off the field, through a players' association if they choose."" The WCA released the statement after the board met this week in Singapore for its annual general meeting, where they also launched a Global Player Hardship Fund. The fund was created to support international players in need ""who are not covered by the game's existing domestic frameworks for support."" ""We are certain it is going to assist those current and recently retired international cricketers who are presently unsupported and vulnerable,"" said JP Van Wyk, the WCA's head of welfare and education.","sports"

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on X said that the trophy's tour will begin in Islamabad and will also see scenic travel destinations like Skardu, Murree, Hunza and Muzaffarabad. ""Catch a glimpse of the trophy which Sarfaraz Ahmed lifted in 2017 at The Oval, from 16-24 November,"" wrote the cricket body. The prestigious silverware was brought from Dubai to Islamabad, two days before the scheduled commencement of the trophy tour. Notably, it would be the first instance that an ICC event’s trophy tour will be held before the announcement of the tournament’s schedule, which is typically unveiled four months ahead of the kick off date. Earlier today, it was reported that the broadcasters are pushing the ICC for immediate announcement of the Champions Trophy’s schedule. The schedule for the highly-anticipated tournament was due to be announced earlier this week but the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) refusal resulted in the delay. According to the sources, the broadcasters, who secured the broadcasting rights for a record $3 billion until 2027, were assured a cycle that includes blockbuster Pakistan-India clashes, which typically generate the highest viewership and revenue. However, India’s stubbornness has jeopardised the entire situation and with no clear timeframe for the schedule announcement. It is pertinent to mention that the ICC is currently in a ‘catch-22’ due to India’s decision to not travel Pakistan and the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) firm stance against the proposed hybrid model.","sports"

Minutes from the board meeting indicate that the schedule, also approved by ICC broadcasters, was shared with all participating teams, and no objections were raised, highly placed sources confirmed. ""A match schedule has been developed in conjunction with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The 15 matches are to be hosted across three venues in Pakistan: Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Karachi. ""The match schedule has been approved by ICC's main broadcast partner,Star, and each participating team has received a copy of their schedule for the event. No member has raised any concerns with the schedule as circulated,"" it stated. A source in Islamabad with knowledge of the matter suggested that recent developments, including India's verbal communication to the cricket's regulatory body about its inability to travel to Pakistan, may point to ""mala fide intentions"" aimed at creating disruption ahead of the Champions Trophy. ""There was no discussion of such concerns during the ICC Board meeting, the appropriate forum to address such matters. Yet, just as Pakistan was set to host an event marking 100 days to the tournament, the BCCI informed the ICC of its position verbally,"" the source said. The source further confirmed that a high-profile event was planned for November 11 to unveil the match schedule, event identity, and trophy tour. During the October board meeting, the PCB had also provided updates on the progress of development work at the three venues. The source added that the ICC had also green-signalled the PCB to host an international testing event at all three venues before the Champions Trophy which the PCB was planning to hold in January. Before the October meeting, the PCB and ICC had jointly briefed security managers from all participating teams on the tournament's master security plan. No objections were raised at any stage, the source added. The PCB, meanwhile, is awaiting a response from the ICC to a questionnaire sent two days back following India's verbal communication to the ICC about its inability to travel to Pakistan. ""The delay in ICC's reply suggests there is no written communication from the BCCI. If such a document existed, it would have been shared with the PCB by now. It has been two days since PCB wrote to the ICC,"" the source noted. ""Pakistan was announced as the host of the Champions Trophy long ago, and the host agreement was signed in December 2023. Why didn't the BCCI consult its government about travelling to Pakistan when the event was announced? Why wait until the last minute?"" the source questioned. With less than 100 days to go before the ICC Champions Trophy, the uncertainty surrounding the schedule is not only frustrating cricket fans globally but also affecting stakeholders with commercial interests tied to the tournament. ""A lot of branding and brand activation activities are currently on hold due to this uncertainty,"" another source said. The final schedule, though already shared with participating teams and broadcasters, for the Champions Trophy 2025 is yet to be announced, officially.","sports"

The Men in Green only managed to score 64/9 in pursuit of a daunting 94-run target in seven overs. The visitors had a decent start as they amassed 12 runs for the loss of one wicket in the first over. Pakistan then ran into a disastrous middle-order collapse, including the the dismissals of key batters Babar Azam (3) and captain Mohammad Rizwan (0), and were consequently reduced to 20/5 in three overs. Xavier Bartlett, who picked up two wickets in his first over, dismissed Salman Ali Agha (4) to keep Pakistan under pressure. The right-arm pacer recorded brilliant bowling figures of 13/3 in his quota of two overs. Coming out to bat at No.8 with the visitors reeling at 24/6 in 3.2 overs, Abbas Afridi offered a notable fightback against the momentum-filled Australian bowling attack with an unbeaten 20-run cameo. His efforts, however, were not enough to steer his side over the line as Pakistan succumbed to a 29-run defeat in the series opener. Nathan Ellis led the bowling charge for Australia with astounding figures of 3/9 in two overs, while Adam Zampa bagged two wickets. Earlier, Glenn Maxwell’s blitzing powered Australia to a formidable total of 93 in first T20I. In a match that was reduced to seven overs per side, Pakistan’s captain Rizwan won the toss and put Australia into bat. The hosts came out all guns blazing with openers Jake Fraser-McGurk and Matthew Short scoring 16 runs off the first over, bowled by ace pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi. Naseem Shah drew first success for Pakistan by dismissing Fraser-McGurk, nine off five, on the first delivery of his spell. But Maxwell, promoted to bat at No.3, dominated the proceedings despite Short’s departure in the third over. The hard-hitting batter eventually fell victim to Mohammad Abbas in the penultimate over, which also saw the ouster of Tim David (9) as Australia slipped to 73/4 in six overs. Maxwell remained the top-scorer for Australia with a 19-ball 43, laced with five fours and three sixes. Marcus Stoinis then smashed Naseem for 20 runs in the final over and bolstered Australia’s total to 93/4 in the allotted seven overs. The right-handed batter remained unbeaten with a seven-ball 21, which featured two fours and a six. For Pakistan, Abbas bagged two wickets, while Shaheen and Naseem shared two between them. Days earlier, the Men in Green celebrated a significant triumph after defeating the Kangaroos in the third and final ODI, clinching the three-match series 2-1. With this win, the Green Shirts marked their first ODI series win on Australian soil in 22 years, with the previous 50-over series victory dating back to 2002. Additionally, it is worth noting that Pakistan are playing their first match since their dismal ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 campaign, which saw them crashing out from the group stage of the tournament for the first time due to their gut-wrenching defeats against the United States and arch-rivals India. Australia, on the other hand, are fresh from a 3-0 routing of Scotland and a 1-1 stalemate against fierce rivals England.

The 22-year-old left-hander made an unbeaten 107 off 56 balls in an Indian total of 219-6. South Africa were restricted to 208-7, giving India an unbeatable 2-1 lead in the four-match series. ""I was waiting for this for a long time, coming back after injury,"" Varma told host broadcaster SuperSport, referring to a hand injury which restricted his playing time in 2024. Varma epitomised the ""fearless cricket"" espoused by captain Suryakumar Yadav. Promoted to number three in the batting order, he faced the third ball of the match after Sanju Samson was bowled for a second successive duck by  Marco Jansen. He immediately went on the attack, hitting the second and third balls he faced from Jansen for four and six as he launched an innings which included eight fours and seven sixes. ""I was just thinking I have got an opportunity to bat at number three and I just wanted to express myself,"" he said. ""We played the brand of cricket we wanted to play,"" said Suryakumar, who revealed that Varma had requested a promotion up the batting order. ""He asked for it and he responded,"" said the captain. Fellow left-hander  Abhishek Sharma was similarly aggressive, hitting 50 off 25 balls with three fours and five sixes in a second-wicket stand of 107 off 52  deliveries with Varma. South Africa were never up with the required run rate but some big hitting by Heinrich Klaasen (41) and Jansen (54)  enabled the hosts to score 105 runs off the last seven overs. Klaasen hit three sixes off successive balls from leg-spinner Varun  Chakravarthy, India´s most successful bowler in the first two matches. Jansen thrashed a 16-ball half-century before falling leg before wicket to left-arm opening bowler Arshdeep Singh off the third ball of the final over. Put under pressure by Abhishek and Varma, South Africa bowled  three no-balls and 10 wides, which ultimately proved the difference  between the two teams, with India bowling only one wide ","sports"

The video also highlights the logo of ICC Champions Trophy 2025, Pakistan. “The newly created visual identity is a digital-first vibrant expression, deliberately challenging the status quo, with an unconventional typographic logo which sets the tone for the look – bold and loud, confident and fun,” said an ICC statement. “It has been designed to be agile, distinctive, and expressive, it’s inspired by the language of cricket; from the unique and integral words that describe the game, to the shouts when a wicket falls, to the name of each superstar that appears on the back of their kit. Both the verbal and written words are an integral part of the sport and that is celebrated through the brand,” the statement added.

According to informed sources, the PCB has written a letter to the ICC seeking answers to a few critical questions. Sources indicate that the PCB has asked the cricket's governing body when the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) informed them that the Indian cricket team would not participate in the Champions Trophy scheduled to be held in Pakistan in February 2025. The PCB has also inquired whether the BCCI has formally notified the ICC in writing about their refusal. Additionally, the PCB has questioned the reasons provided by the Indian cricket board, if any, for their decision not to visit Pakistan. The PCB has also requested a copy of the written communication from the BCCI explaining their reasons, so these can be reviewed. Another question raised by the PCB is how the ICC has responded to the BCCI's refusal to send their team. Sources suggest that after obtaining answers to these questions, the PCB plans to seek legal advice and consult with the government for guidance in formulating its next steps. However, sources have also stated that if India indeed refuses to send its cricket team to Pakistan and the ICC accepts this refusal, the PCB will categorically refuse to play any matches against the Indian cricket team during the Champions Trophy under any circumstances. Meanwhile, contrary to the reports in the Indian press that suggested that the ICC could move the event outside of Pakistan, the sources said that there's no such development. ""ICC has not approached Cricket South Africa to host the Champions Trophy,"" the source said. Another source added that it will be a tough challenge for the ICC to relocate the Champions Trophy outside of Pakistan, with less than 100 days remaining before the event. ""How can they just move it? They need boards' approvals for a start, they need a valid reason to shift it and what could be a valid reason, and when all other boards are regularly visiting Pakistan for bilateral events, how would they vote against an ICC event in Pakistan,"" the source said. ""And, no way do they take it away without a challenge from the PCB,"" it said, adding that the current stance by the Pakistan Cricket Board has already created headache for ICC which wasn't expecting this reaction. Another source toldGeo Newsthat there were three options one of them was a hybrid model — which Pakistan has already refused, publicly. And, without the host's agreement, the ICC can't proceed with a hybrid model. The other option was to relocate the event out of Pakistan — but it also seems a big challenge for the ICC. Now the only option left is to find a middle way. ""The ball is now in ICC's court, they’ve to ensure the revenue as well so they’re in a catch-22 situation. The Indians are not travelling to Pakistan, and as a result, Pakistan have taken a stand that it will not play against India, so this is a difficult situation for the ICC,"" the source said. ""And, when you talk about revenue, ICC knows it can't minus Pakistan. It knows the value of Pakistan cricket and understands its contribution to cricket revenue and that's why they are eager to make sure both India and Pakistan play each other at least once in the ICC Champions Trophy,” the source said. To make things difficult for the cricket's governing body, there is no precedent of a tournament being shifted outside the actual host to accommodate one team, or when one team was unable to travel to any country.

The development comes amid the ongoing ambiguity surrounding India's participation in the mega-event, set to be hosted by Pakistan in February-March next year. Earlier, the sources had said that the PCB intended to write to the ICC after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCC) verbally informed the international body of its decision to not send its team to Pakistan for the said tournament. The ICC then communicated the matter to the PCB which prompted the latter to consult with the Pakistani government on the issue. The board intends to present a firm stance, reflecting the government's advisory, and has decided to not accept any ""hybrid model"" provisioning any of its Champions Trophy matches outside Pakistan. ""If India's participation contributes to ICC’s revenue, the PCB’s role is equally crucial, and without Pakistan-India matches, the ICC revenues would suffer significantly,"" say sources. The board intends to present a firm stance, reflecting the government's advisory, and has decided to not accept any ""hybrid model"" provisioning any of its Champions Trophy matches outside Pakistan. ""If India's participation contributes to ICC’s revenue, the PCB’s role is equally crucial, and without Pakistan-India matches, the ICC revenues would suffer significantly,"" say sources. Also, there's a chance of Pakistan boycotting ICC events in India altogether for ""mixing sports with politics"" and refusing to visit Pakistan. The prospective move, if executed, could have major financial and structural consequences for global cricket as Pakistan's absence could weaken viewership and ICC’s projected revenue from broadcasters and sponsors. The ICC, which secured $3.2 billion from broadcast rights for the 2024-2027 cycle and anticipates $1 billion more in other revenue, relies heavily on marquee events featuring Pakistan and India, which consistently attract record viewership and engagement. “No India vs Pakistan games in ICC events mean all broadcast and sponsorship deals would fall out,” said a source who noted that a match in the ICC event is important for global cricket. In recent years, the ICC has made sure that India play Pakistan at least once in each of the global cricketing events, ensuring a major chunk of revenue from this game. The match between arch-rivals at the 2023 World Cup drew unprecedented interest, with 173 million viewers on Indian TV and 225 million digital viewers. It is to be noted that India has not played an international match in Pakistan since 2008. Last year, the BCCI declined to send a team to Pakistan for the Asia Cup, leading to a hybrid format with later stages held in Sri Lanka. However, Pakistan did visit India soon after for the 2023 ODI World Cup, where they fell short of reaching the semi-finals.","sports"
"58","PTA conducts second trial to block unregistered VPNs","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576177-pta-conducts-second-trial-to-block-unregistered-vpns","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has commenced its second trial aimed at blocking unregistered Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) using a firewall system,The Newsreported. According to PTA sources, this trial will span two days, during which unregistered VPNs will be actively blocked as part of the process. The initiative follows a previously successful trial, demonstrating the authority's ability to restrict access to unregistered VPNs effectively. It should be noted that the PTA has given a deadline of November 30 for the registration of unregistered VPNs. Regular blocking of unregistered VPNs will be started from December 1. Starting from November 30, the government is set to enforce a restrictive new policy that will refrain internet users in Pakistan from accessing VPNs. The PTA only offers VPN registration to companies and freelancers who use these services for commercial purposes, a senior official of the state regulator PTA confirmed toThe News. As of now, this policy excludes ordinary users who rely on VPNs for online privacy or to access content including restricted news websites or social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter). The Ministry of Interior had earlier this month issued a directive to the PTA chairman to block ""illegal VPNs"" nationwide. ""VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities,"" the directive stated. ""VPNs are also being used to discreetly access pornographic and blasphemous content."" The ministry urged companies to register their VPNs by November 30. A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, establishes a secure and encrypted internet connection, enabling users to protect their online activity from surveillance, censorship, and data theft. During the current year, using VPNs has become a necessity for Pakistani online users due to increasing restrictions and unexplained social media outages. In February, the government blocked X, citing ""national security concerns."" While in July, users reported difficulties in sending and receiving media files on WhatsApp, a problem that persists for some even today. The growing censorship has driven VPN usage up, with only ProtonVPN reporting a 350% increase in sign-ups on November 10.","science"

Although hours have passed, the cause of the outage remains unknown, and no official notification has been issued, raising questions about its timing. The government had confirmed that they planned on disrupting internet services in areas with security concerns, but there was no comment about social media platforms. Downdetector.com — which tracks real-time overview of issues and outages of websites and social platforms — showed that users of Pakistan were facing disruptions in accessing WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and other sites. However, the disruptions were not only restricted to social platforms, but internet was affected as well. Shahjahan Khurram, an Islamabad-based journalist, said that the recent internet disruptions, be it the closure of X, slowed internet speeds across the country, or the banning of virtual private networks, have made life difficult for Pakistanis. ""To survive without the internet and go about your daily activities, whether it be your job or academic activities, in this day and age, seems extremely difficult."" Another citizen of Islamabad, Farhad Jarral said that the government seems to ""unveil a new level of innovation"" in restricting citizens’ access to the internet whenever PTI announces a protest in Islamabad. ""This time, not only were major social media platforms blocked, but even VPNs—normally a reliable workaround—were rendered ineffective,"" he said. In Karachi, 27-year-old Tallal Aazmi told Geo.tv: ""The internet is so slow right now, I can’t even share media on WhatsApp. It’s super frustrating and slows everything down."" Rabia, a resident of Lahore, said that the government has ""been curtailing our right to information and freedom of speech which is a violation of our rights while the irony is that they themselves are using these platforms"". ""The government needs to realise these shutdowns are not only impacting the public but making us a laughing stock on international platforms,"" she added. State Minister for IT, Shaza Fatima Khawaja, quoted PTI’s protest post on X with her own remarks, terming it a ""Fitna Call"" and highlighting the government’s narrative in response to PTI's mobilisation efforts. This further underscores how political rivalry increasingly finds its battleground in digital spaces, leaving ordinary citizens caught in the crossfire. PTI founder Imran Khan has called on supporters to gather at D-Chowk in the capital and stay there until their demands are met, and it can be expected that the disruptions will persist. In response, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government has stationed tens of thousands of police and paramilitary personnel in riot gear and obstructed highways leading to Islamabad to prepare for the opposition’s protest rally.","science"

This infant world, estimated at around 10 to 20 times the mass of Earth, is one of the youngest planets beyond our solar system - called exoplanets - ever discovered. It resides alongside the remnants of the disk of dense gas and dust circling the host star - called a protoplanetary disk - that provided the ingredients for the planet to form. The star it orbits is expected to become a stellar type called an orange dwarf, less hot and less massive than our sun. The star's mass is about  70% that of the sun and it is about half as luminous. It is located in our Milky Way galaxy about 520 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). ""This discovery confirms that planets can be in a cohesive form within 3  million years, which was previously unclear as Earth took 10 to 20  million years to form,"" said Madyson Barber, a graduate student in the Department of Physics and astronomy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature. ""We don't know how long it takes for planets to form,"" UNC  astrophysicist and study co-author Andrew Mann added. ""We know that giant planets must form faster than their disk dissipates because they need a lot of gas from the disk. But disks take 5 to 10 million years to dissipate. So do planets form in 1 million years? 5? 10?"" The planet, given the names IRAS 04125+2902 b and TIDYE-1b, orbits its star every 8.8 days at a distance of about one-fifth that separates our solar system's innermost planet Mercury from the sun. Its mass is in between that of Earth, the largest of our solar system's rocky planets, and Neptune, the smallest of the gas planets. It is less dense than Earth and has a diameter about 11 times greater. Its chemical composition is not known. The researchers suspect that the planet formed further away from its star and then migrated inward. ""Forming large planets close to the star is difficult because the protoplanetary disk dissipates away from closest to the star the fastest, meaning there's not enough material to form a large planet that closes that quickly,"" Barber said. The researchers detected it using what is called the ""transit"" method,  observing a dip in the host star's brightness when the planet passes in front of it, from the perspective of a viewer on Earth. It was found by  NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, space telescope. ""This is the youngest-known transiting planet. It is on par with the youngest planets known,"" Barber said. Exoplanets not detected using this method sometimes are directly imaged using telescopes. But these typically are massive ones, around 10 times greater than our solar system's largest planet Jupiter. Stars and planets form from clouds of interstellar gas and dust. ""To form a star-planet system, the cloud of gas and dust will collapse and spin into a flat environment, with the star at the centre and the disk surrounding it. Planets will form in that disk. The disk will then dissipate starting from the inner region near the star,"" Barber said. ""It was previously thought that we wouldn't be able to find a transiting planet this young because the disk would be in the way. But for some reason that we aren't sure of, the outer disk is warped, leaving a perfect window to the star and allowing us to detect the transit,""  Barber added.","science"

""I'll be able to do some everyday tasks with this artificial hand,"" said student Hafeez Mohammad Hossain, 19, whose right hand was ripped off in gunfire on August 5. It was the same day protesters stormed Hasinas palace as she fled to India by helicopter. In the middle of the chaos, Hossain said a police officer levelled a shotgun at him and fired. He described searing pain as gun pellets lacerated his back and leg. Surgeons picked out the gunshot, but were unable to save his hand. ""I can't write anymore,"" Hossain said. ""I'm struggling to learn how to write with my left hand."" On Thursday, he was fitted with a prosthetic limb, alongside four other students who also lost their hands during the months-long protests in which at least 700 people were killed during a police crackdown. Robolife Technologies, a Bangladeshi organisation manufacturing artificial hands, said the prosthetic limbs use sensors connected to the nerves to move. The company says it allows users to grasp objects, to type and use a phone. ""If you ask me whether they work like organic hands, I'd say no,"" said Antu Karim, who is working on the government-backed project to fit the limbs. ""But these hands allow the boys to hold a glass if thirsty, or a spoon to eat,"" he added. ""At least, they won't be looked down upon for not having hands."" Hasina's 15-year tenure saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents. Limbless protesters held a rally earlier this month demanding the interim government who took over after Hasina's fall support those injured in the protests. Many say they have not received the aid they need. The four other former protesters who had arms fitted on Thursday included Mohammad Mamun Mia, 32, a father of two, whose hand was hacked off by a gang he said was loyal to Hasina's Awami League party. The new arm is far from perfect, but it has made a huge difference. ""I'll be able to do some regular tasks with this hand,"" he said, saying that while he cannot work driving a tractor in the fields again, he hopes now to open a small business. Arif Hossain Sagar, 19, had his hand amputated after it failed to heal from an injury he sustained during the protests, and doctors worried about gangrene. ""I can't do any regular activities now,"" Sagar toldAFP. ""I rely on others for eating or bathing."" The new hand will return a degree of normality to his life, he said. Nayeem Hasan, wounded when attackers pounced on him as he went to donate blood to help those injured after a fire, broke into tears. The new arm would help him fulfil his simple dream.

Reports from outage tracking website, Downdetector, noted a peak of 207 complaints within an hour, primarily around 10pm on Saturday, with 67% of users experiencing difficulties in sending messages, especially media files, and 16% facing problems receiving them. The disruptions in the Meta-owned instant messaging app predominantly affected Punjab, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa saw sporadic issues. Meanwhile, Karachi reported the most significant impact from the disruptions across Sindh, according to Downdetector's heat map. Sources within the IT industry acknowledged facing problems while sharing media files. However, no one knew what the problem was. Internet service providers also faced backlash from customers due to the sudden outage of WhatsApp, with users complaining about their inability to share media files, but could not point to the cause of the issue. In the absence of any official notification, some users linked the disruptions with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) much-hyped protest in Islamabad today (Sunday). WhatsApp disruptions in the country have become a recurring issue, particularly during events like the PTI's protests. Officials, however, have routinely attributed these outages to technical issues or submarine cable damage. On X (formerly Twitter), accounts affiliated with the PTI started a campaign on Saturday, requesting X owner Elon Musk, who also owns SpaceX, to make Starlink available in Pakistan. Starlink is a satellite network developed by the private spaceflight company SpaceX to provide low-cost internet to remote locations.","science"
"64","Water may have existed on Mars for longer than previously thought ","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575958-water-may-have-existed-on-mars-for-longer-than-previously-thought","Scientists have discovered the oldest evidence of flowing hot water on Earth’s neighbouring planet Mars, indicating that the planet may have supported life ages ago. The said evidence was delivered to Earth and sealed within the Martian meteorite NWA7034, which was found in 2011 in the Sahara Desert. Due to its black, highly polished, and shiny appearance, the rock is also known as “Black Beauty”. It is also the oldest Martian meteorite ever discovered, estimated at 2 billion years old. Interestingly, a team from Curtin University has found something even older than the rock itself: a 4.45 billion-year-old zircon grain that has fingerprints of liquids-rich in water, according toSpace.com. Aaron Cavosie from Curtin’s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences believes the new discovery will help us understand the hydrothermal systems associated with the volcanic magma activity that once ran through the Red Planet. ""We used nano-scale geochemistry to detect elemental evidence of hot water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago,"" Cavosie said in a statement. ""Hydrothermal systems were essential for the development of life on Earth, and our findings suggest Mars also had water, a key ingredient for habitable environments, during the earliest history of crust formation,” he added. The researcher added that they identified specific elements in the unique zircon speck through nano-scale imaging and spectroscopy. The elements included iron and aluminium. Cavosie added that the team identified specific elements in this unique zircon fragment through nano-scale imaging and spectroscopy, which allows the chemical composition of objects to be determined. These included the elements iron, aluminium, yttrium and sodium. ""These elements were added as the zircon formed 4.45 billion years ago, suggesting water was present during early Martian magmatic activity,"" Cavosie said. Scientists believe that Mars lost its water billions of years ago when the planet was stripped of its atmosphere by harsh solar radiation. The loss of it meant there was no force stopping the water vapours from escaping into space. Regardless of the mentioned facts, this new research implies that water may have existed on Mars even earlier than it was previously thought to exist. ""A 2022 Curtin study of the same zircon grain found it had been 'shocked' by a meteorite impact, marking it as the first and only known shocked zircon from Mars,"" Cavosie said. ""This new study takes us a step further in understanding early Mars by identifying tell-tale signs of water-rich fluids from when the grain formed, providing geochemical markers of water in the oldest known Martian crust,” he added.","science"

Black holes only form when massive stars die. Those stars need to form, live, die, and then birth black holes. However, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed that these dark abysses existed at the edge of the cosmic dawn or a few hundred million years after the Big Bang and the first stars and galaxies started to come into being, according toLiveScience. A paper from theJournal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physicssuggests that these giant black holes may have been born early in our universe. Renowned scientist Stephen Hawking proposed in the 1970s that it is possible that the universe produced several black holes in the early epochs of the Big Bang. Hawking further explained that they would have been born directly from matter and energy compressed and released during the explosion and the subsequent birth of our universe. He also suggested that they would dissolve slowly through what is known as Hawking radiation and be visible in the present. Extensive surveys and research have not found evidence of those early black holes so even if they exist, it is possible that they only amount to a tiny fraction of matter in the universe. The researchers also found that the supposed “tiny fraction” of black holes could have grown over 100 million years and if they found themselves surrounded densely by the collections of matter, they could have absorbed enough energy and material to reach the supermassive status in which the JWST observed them. This takes another turn as those black holes would not have grown after the formation of the first stars and their deaths but rather alongside them. This idea, for now, is just a hypothesis.","science"
"66","What forcing Google to sell Chrome could mean","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575915-what-forcing-google-to-sell-chrome-could-mean","US antitrust lawyers are calling on a judge to force the sale of Google's Chrome browser to limit the company's market clout in a move that would shake up the internet giant. On Wednesday, the US Department of Justice submitted its recommendation for the breakup to US District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who is set to impose steps next year to address Google's monopoly power in online search. ""This would be a huge gut punch to Google,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Google provides free search, making money off targeting ads and features that promote online commerce. ""It would greatly alter (Google's) business model,"" said Syracuse University professor of advertising Beth Egan. Selling Chrome would also deprive Google of a rich source of information used to train its algorithms and promote its other services like Maps. Launched in 2008, Chrome dominates the browser market, dwarfing rivals Edge and Safari, developed by Microsoft and Apple, respectively. Egan believed Google would find a way to recover if forced to sell Chrome. ""I don't think divesting the browser is going to kill Google as a company,"" Egan said. She noted that it could be its users who wind up suffering, given the case Google is making in blog posts on the matter. ABloomberganalyst estimates that Chrome, which is used by more than three billion people around the world, would sell for at least $15 billion. But given the lack of precedent, predicting how much Chrome would fetch on the market is tricky. A Chinese investment group bought an internet browser from Opera Software ASA in Norway for $600 million in 2016, but it only claimed 350 million users at the time. There are very few potential buyers for Chrome, according to Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. ""It's likely that any company with deep enough pockets to afford Chrome is already under antitrust scrutiny,"" Mitchell-Wolf said. ""If I had to speculate, my inclination is to look at US-based artificial intelligence players."" While Chrome being bought by the likes of OpenAI would certainly raise antitrust concerns, the US government could see it as a way for the nation to prioritise innovation on the global stage. Elon Musk's AI startup could conceivably be a Chrome contender, bankrolled by his riches and having the deal cleared thanks to his close working relationship with incoming president Donald Trump. Analysts agreed that people will keep using Chrome regardless of who owns it, provided the quality doesn't plummet. ""This assumes Chrome retains its most popular features and continues innovating,"" said analyst Mitchell-Wolf. ""Search behaviors are a function of convenience first, trust and experience second."" The justice department's argument that people use Chrome because it is a default search engine in devices is off the mark, the analyst added. Many doubt that Judge Mehta will embrace all of the justice department's proposed remedies in the case. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino considered the measures ""extreme and unlikely to be imposed by the court."" The incoming Trump administration also ""remains a wild card"" regarding whether justice officials will back off the idea of breaking up Google. Trump in October indicated he opposes dismantling Google, believing such a move would be against the interests of the US internationally. ""China is afraid of Google"" and a breakup would hurt the company, Trump reasoned at the time. Meanwhile, Trump has also accused Google of being unfair to conservatives.","science"

By following their guidelines, people may be able to take control of their privacy in this vastly digital world. To begin the test, select a unique topic that has no connection to anything the person taking the test has searched for, expressed interest in online, or casually mentioned near their phone — something that would not typically arise in their advertisements. For accurate results, they must refrain from discussing this topic out loud beforehand. Instead, write it down on a piece of paper. However, if they must talk about it, they must make sure to turn off their phone or leave it in another room to eliminate any potential interference. After selecting a topic, the next step is to have multiple conversations about it near the phone over the next few days. These discussions must be focused on the chosen subject, incorporating specific phrases and keywords that might activate search engines. Using targeted terms can enhance the likelihood of engaging their phone's software or related advertising systems, ultimately increasing the chances of receiving relevant The third step is for the test taker to continue using their phone as they normally would and not interact with any content that could be linked to the test topic in any way. They must leave everything to the conversations and see if the device picks up on them through the microphone or other sensors. After several days of regular phone usage, they must take note of any changes in your targeted ads that appear in their social media feeds, streaming services, or other connected platforms, particularly those related — either directly or indirectly — to your secret topic. If they notice ads relating to the secret topic appearing without any direct interaction on their phone, it could indicate that the phone has been listening in on the conversations. ""While we typically brush them off as innocent and necessary, they are a strong indicator that you are allowing your device too much access to your personal data and interests,” said Marijus Briedis, the chief technology officer at NordVPN. While using audio information for targeted advertising isn't illegal, many individuals feel uncomfortable when they learn that their phones are listening and gathering data. Most users unknowingly consent to this through app agreements. However, to protect their privacy and maintain confidentiality in conversations, cybersecurity experts recommend disabling virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as any apps that have access to the phone's microphone.","science"
"70","First 'zoomed-in' image of star outside Milky Way revealed","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575561-first-zoomed-in-image-of-star-outside-milky-way-revealed","PARIS: Scientists said Thursday they have taken the first ever close-up image of a star outside of the Milky Way, capturing a blurry shot of a dying behemoth 2,000 times bigger than the Sun. Roughly 160,000 light years from Earth, the star WOH G64 sits in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. An astrophysicist at Chile's Andres Bello National University Keiichi Ohnaka, said that ""for the first time, we have succeeded in taking a zoomed-in image of a dying star"". It is a red supergiant, which is the largest type of star in the universe because they expand into space as they near their explosive deaths. The image was captured by a team of researchers using a new instrument of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. The image shows the bright blurry yellow star enclosed inside an oval outline. ""We discovered an egg-shaped cocoon closely surrounding the star,"" Ohnaka said in a statement. ""We are excited because this may be related to the drastic ejection of material from the dying star before a supernova explosion,"" added the lead author of a study published in the journalAstronomy and Astrophysics. Ohnaka's team has been watching the star for some time. In 2005 and 2007, they used the Very Large Telescope's interferometer, which combined the light from two telescopes, to learn more about the star. But capturing an image remained out of reach until a new instrument called GRAVITY — which combines the light of four telescopes — recently came online. When they compared all their observations, the astronomers were surprised to find that the star had dimmed over the last decade. ""The star has been experiencing a significant change in the last 10 years, providing us with a rare opportunity to witness a star's life in real time,"" said study co-author Gerd Weigelt of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. Red super-giants —  such as Betelgeuse in the Orion constellation —  are ""one of the most extreme of its kind, and any drastic change may bring it closer to an explosive end,"" added study co-author Jacco van Loon of Keele University in the UK. In their final stages of life, before they go supernova, red super-giants shed their outer layers of gas and dust in a process that can last thousands of years. It could be this expelled material that is making the star appear dimmer, the scientists said. This could also explain the strange shape of the dust cocoon that surrounds the star. Another explanation for the egg-shaped cocoon could be that there is another star hidden somewhere inside that has not yet been discovered.","science"
"71","US govt calls for breakup of Google and Chrome","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575522-us-govt-calls-for-breakup-of-google-and-chrome","The US government late Wednesday asked a judge to order the dismantling of Google by selling its widely used Chrome browser in a major antitrust crackdown on the internet giant. In a court filing, the US Department of Justice urged a shake-up of Google’s business that includes banning deals for Google to be the default search engine on smartphones and preventing it from exploiting its Android mobile operating system. Antitrust officials said in the filing that Google should also be made to sell Android if proposed remedies don’t prevent the tech company from using its control of the mobile operating system to its advantage. Justice officials ""chose to push a radical interventionist agenda,"" Google president of global affairs Kent Walker said in response to the filing. Calling for the breakup of Google marks a profound change by the US government’s regulators, which have largely left tech giants alone since failing to break up Microsoft two decades ago. Google is expected to make its recommendations in a filing next month and rival sides will argue their positions at a hearing in April before US District Court Judge Amit Mehta. Regardless of Judge Mehta’s eventual decision, Google is expected to appeal the ruling, prolonging the process for years and potentially leaving the final say to the US Supreme Court. The case could also be upended by the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House in January. His administration will likely replace the current team in charge of the DOJ’s antitrust division. The newcomers could choose to carry on with the case, ask for a settlement with Google or abandon the case altogether. Trump has blown hot and cold in how to handle Google and the dominance of big tech companies. He has accused the search engine of bias against conservative content, but has also signaled that a forced break up of the company would be too large a demand by the US government. Determining how to address Google’s wrongs is the next stage of the landmark antitrust trial that saw the company in August ruled a monopoly by Judge Mehta. The proposal ""would break a range of Google products"" and chill the company’s investment in artificial intelligence, according to Walker. ""DOJ’s approach would result in unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses — and jeopardise America’s global economic and technological leadership,"" Walker said. Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of industry trade group Chamber of Progress, said the government’s demands were ""fantastical"" and defied legal standards, instead calling for narrowly tailored remedies. The trial, which concluded last year, scrutinised Google’s confidential agreements with smartphone manufacturers, including Apple. These deals involve substantial payments to secure Google’s search engine as the default option on browsers, iPhones and other devices. The judge determined that this arrangement provided Google with unparalleled access to user data, enabling it to develop its search engine into a globally dominant platform. From this position, Google expanded its tech and data-gathering empire to include the Chrome browser, Maps and the Android smartphone operating system. The US government currently has five cases pending against big tech over antitrust concerns after the Biden administration adopted a tough stance on reining in the dominance of the companies. If carried through by the Trump administration, the cases against Amazon, Meta and Apple, as well as two against Google, could take years to litigate.","science"
"72","VPN registration: PTA urged for sufficient time, consultation to avoid disruption","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575520-vpn-registration-pta-urged-for-sufficient-time-consultation-to-avoid-disruption","Amid the looming November 30 registration deadline, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has been urged to ensure sufficient time for registration and consultation on unregistered Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to avoid disruption. The request, as per a press release issued by the PTA on Thursday, was made by the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) during a consultation session hosted by the regulatory authority at its headquarters. The huddle also included stakeholders, including the Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) chief executive officer (CEO), Pakistan Freelancers Association (PAFLA) chairman, representatives from the Ministry of IT and Telecom (MoIT), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and P@SHA chairman. The session comes against the backdrop of the incumbent government's decision to limit the use of VPNs to only those which are duly registered, whereas those which aren't are set to face a crackdown commencing on December 1. The prospective action is to be interpreted against reports suggesting that Pakistanis make up to 20 million daily attempts to access blocked explicit content using unregistered VPNs, despite government restrictions. A successful trial of VPN blocking has already been conducted, and a second trial is planned to ensure readiness for the full-scale shutdown. The PTA has maintained that unregistered VPNs are considered a significant security risk, as they can be exploited to access sensitive data and facilitate criminal activities. During the consultative gathering, the regulatory body reaffirmed its commitment to enabling legitimate VPN users by ensuring data security and seamless internet access, especially for software houses, BPO firms, banks, embassies, and freelancers. Furthermore, the stakeholders discussed mechanisms to improve VPN registration while ensuring business continuity and secure internet services. The PTA's registration process involves completing an online form and providing basic details, including CNIC, company registration details, and taxpayer status. Freelancers must submit documentation, such as a letter or email, verifying their project or company association. Additionally, applicants must provide the IP address for VPN connectivity. If a fixed IP address is required, it can be acquired from an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The registration process is free, and approvals are typically granted within 8-10 hours of submission. Any individual requiring a VPN for commercial purposes can apply under the ""Freelancer"" category and needs to provide the required information, including supporting evidence from the employer.","science"

While the new feature will be rolled out in an upcoming update, it's currently available to some beta testers in the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.24.23 update, which is available on the Google Play Store,WABetaInforeported. The new feature introduces a new entry point to open the camera directly within the gallery sheet. In an update introduced earlier, WhatsApp rolled out a feature to open the photo and video gallery from the chat bar, replacing the previous camera entry point. This made it easier for users to access their gallery content without navigating through multiple steps. However, some users might prefer the previous shortcut, which opened the camera directly. They may find the new gallery shortcut less convenient, as it adds an extra step to open the camera, which was previously a one-tap process. For users who only have the gallery shortcut available in the chat bar, WhatsApp is now adding a camera entry point directly to the gallery sheet, partially bringing back the convenience that was reduced when the gallery shortcut replaced the direct camera option. It is important to note that the new camera shortcut within the gallery sheet may not be accessible to users who still have the camera shortcut in the chat bar. This is a deliberate decision by WhatsApp to avoid redundancy and keep the interface clean. The new feature is rolling out to even more people over the coming weeks.","science"

Here's why it's complicated","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575481-psha-chairman-reveals-whether-someone-using-vpn-can-be-caught","It would not be easy to catch someone involved in nefarious activities using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), even with registration, a top IT sector official warned on Thursday, adding that the policy’s implementation could deal a significant economic blow to the country’s 2.3 million IT workers. ""When you are connected to a VPN, it has a secure transaction. Nobody knows what data is going through this VPN, so catching (someone using) this is not that easy,"" said Sajjad Mustafa Syed, Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) Chairman, while speaking onGeo Newsprogramme, ""Geo Pakistan"". Syed revealed this in response to a query about whether it was possible to arrest someone involved in criminal or terrorist activities using VPNs, an encrypted internet network, even after registration. To another query about whether perpetrators using VPNs could not be caught and what the use of the registration process was, he said the country would only end up creating classes of digital haves and have-nots. ""Some people would be able to access the digital world, and the rest will not be able to do that."" The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on November 13 introduced a streamlined process for legitimate users to register their VPNs. The development came days after the regulatory body began blocking unregistered VPNs in Pakistan to ""regulate internet security and ensure the safety of users."" Sources within the PTA said unregistered VPNs posed a significant security risk, as they might allow unauthorised access to sensitive data. Furthermore, they could potentially provide access to illegal content. Explaining VPN registration, the P@SHA chairman said registration for a VPN meant that the PTA would register a static IP of a user or the site the user wanted to access — either end would have to be registered with the PTA for access. ""Here arises the problem, because our (IT) industry cannot do this, as whenever you connect with a VPN, you get a new IP address, and the registration process, as per the PTA, would take about eight hours. Such a lengthy process would delay the work of online freelancers, and companies would then prefer other countries for this job."" ""As far as static IP addresses are concerned, you do not have such a large number of addresses that a multitude of internet users could utilise. So, it is next to impossible to implement this policy,"" he added. Syed said that even if the policy were implemented, concerns related to national security would still not be addressed because even a terrorist could register for a VPN. On the other hand, he said, as per a conservative estimate, the restriction would cause a $1 billion annual loss to the country’s IT exports. Moreover, he said, some large international companies did not want the sharing of IP addresses — whether of the company or the one they were working with — a third party. He added that once they realised this was happening, the contracts would be cancelled. The VPN restriction could deal an economic blow to 2.3 million IT workers in the country, the P@SHA chairman warned. Meanwhile, expressing reservations over the decision, the Wireless & Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP) stressed the need for a balanced policy. Surprisingly, PTA Chairman Hafeez Ur Rehman admitted before the Senate Standing Committee that the IT industry could not progress without VPNs.","science"
"75","Climate change making tropical storms more frequent? Scientists weigh in ","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575445-climate-change-making-tropical-storms-more-frequent-scientists-weigh-in","An unusual cluster of typhoons in the West Pacific and a series of powerful hurricanes in the Atlantic are raising questions about the impact that climate change is having on tropical storms across the globe,Reutersreported. As nations thrashed out the details of a new climate financing package at  COP29 talks in Azerbaijan, the Philippines was hit by its sixth deadly typhoon in a month while the United States was recovering from two devastating hurricanes. Scientists say it remains unclear how much climate change is reshaping the storm season, or if it is responsible for the rare appearance of four tropical cyclones at the same time in the West Pacific - the first time this has happened in November since 1961. Higher sea surface temperatures speed up evaporation and provide additional ""fuel"" for tropical cyclones, boosting rainfall and wind speeds, they say. The latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), published in 2023, expressed ""high confidence"" that global warming would make storms more intense. The Philippines' latest supertyphoon Man-Yi landed on Saturday, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents. At least eight people died on Monday, adding to a death toll of more than 160 since October. ""It is rare to see a cluster of four tropical cyclones in the western north Pacific at the same time,"" said Feng Xiangbo, a tropical storm researcher at Britain's University of Reading. ""(But) blaming climate change ... for this unprecedented event this week is not straightforward,"" he added. Evidence suggests that while climate change is increasing storm intensity, it has also reduced their frequency, especially during what is typically the late season from October to November, Feng said. This year, atmospheric waves that have recently been active near the equator could be an alternative explanation for the unusual uptick, Feng said,  but their relationship with climate change is unclear. The belt of high pressure known as the sub-tropical ridge, part of the global atmospheric circulation system, has been stronger and stretched further north and west than usual, according to Choy Chun Win, Senior  Scientific Officer at the Hong Kong Observatory. The ridge could have steered the storms in a westerly direction, diverting them away from cooler waters and wind shears, which would normally weaken them, providing an explanation why four could coexist, he said. ""However, more research is required to assess the contribution of climate change to the chance occurrence of the multiple tropical cyclones and the longer tropical cyclone season,"" he added. Ben Clarke, weather researcher with London's Grantham Institute on Climate  Change and Environment, said it ""would make sense"" that rising ocean temperatures would extend the typhoon season, but the evidence is not conclusive. ""There has been a clear recent increase in the number of tropical cyclones affecting the Philippines in its less active season from approximately  December to February, but this doesn't tell us much about ...  June-November,"" he said. In an analysis published on Wednesday, US weather researchers Climate  Central said Atlantic hurricanes have intensified significantly this year as a result of record-breaking ocean warming. Since 2019, warmer temperatures have driven average wind speeds up by 18  miles per hour (29 kph) and pushed three hurricanes into the highest  Category 5, the study said. The two deadly Category 5 hurricanes known as Helene and Milton, which hit  Florida in September and October respectively, would have been unlikely without climate change, it said. Research is still ongoing on whether tropical cyclones are becoming more frequent, but there is high scientific confidence that warmer sea temperatures are driving up rainfall and causing higher storm surges,  said Daniel Gilford, Climate Central's lead hurricane researcher. ""While other factors contribute to each storm's strength, the impacts of elevated sea surface temperatures are prominent and significant,"" he said. ""In the Atlantic, more than 80% of storms since 2019 were influenced by warm ocean temperatures caused by carbon pollution.""","science"

""No one has declared the VPNs againstshariahor un-Islamic,"" said Naeemi in a press conference in Islamabad, adding: ""A typing error in our previous statement created a misunderstanding after 'not' was omitted from it."" This formal statement came after the council's November 15 fatwa (Islamic decree) declaring the use of VPNs ""un-Islamic"" drew much criticism from different quarters. He said that the council held a session to discuss the use of social media in the country in light of the Islamic principles. Elaborating on the CII's stance on using social media platforms, Naeemi said that these platforms are effective mediums of public expression, however, they should not be used for blasphemy, religious hatred, extremism, and terrorism. ""If these regulations are being violated, then the use of social media will be un-Islamic,"" the cleric said. Earlier this week, the CII chairman had given a clarification regarding the body's decree for the private gateways, saying its nature as being Islamic or un-Islamic mainly depended on its usage. ""No matter if VPN is registered or unregistered, it will be un-Islamic if it is used for indecent content and false propaganda,"" said Naeemi speaking onGeo Newsmorning show, ""Geo Pakistan"". It is noteworthy to mention here that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has extended grace period for unregistered Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) until November 30.

It was found by the analysis that even at colossal scales the force of gravity behaves as predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, reportedLive Science. Notably, the analysis looked at nearly 6 million galaxies and quasars spanning 11 billion years of cosmic times. The findings announced on Tuesday are part of a years-long study of the history of the cosmos focusing upon dark energy, an invisible and enigmatic force that is accelerating the ongoing expansion of the universe. The researchers used a year of observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, which can capture light from 5,000 galaxies simultaneously. Gravity is one of the universe's fundamental forces. Einstein's theory linked space, time and gravity. It holds that concentrations of mass and energy curve the structure of space-time, influencing the motion of whatever passes nearby. ""Einstein's theory of general relativity describes the motion of massive objects in a gravitational field that they create. It is one of the most successful physical theories that we have. The discovery of the accelerating universe, however, led to suggestions that maybe general relativity needs to be modified,"" said University of Michigan cosmologist Dragan Huterer, co-leader of the working group that interpreted the DESI cosmological data. But the new DESI findings revealed gravity behaving as Einstein foresaw that it would. The Big Bang event 13.8 billion years ago initiated the universe, and it has been expanding ever since. Scientists in 1998 disclosed that this expansion was actually accelerating, with dark energy as the hypothesised reason.","science"
"78","VPN — what is it, how and why it is used?","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575309-vpn-what-is-it-how-and-why-it-is-used","Ever since millions of internet users across Pakistan started facing slow internet speeds with sporadic access issues, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) emerged as a key hack for not only the average joe but also freelancers and other individuals who rely heavily on unhindered internet services. However, the incumbent government then decided to only allow registered VPNs to operate in the country with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority's (PTA) registration deadline expiring on November 30. The scepticism surrounding the usage of VPNs further exacerbated when the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) declared its use ""un-Islamic"" — an opinion which the body later clarified and maintained that it all depended on the purpose for which VPNs were being used. With all the chatter around VPNs, it is important to de-clutter the issue and understand what are they in the first place, how they are used and what benefits they entail. According toKaspersky, VPNs are simply tools which allow users to disguise their identity and surf public domains via a protected network connection. A VPN essentially hides the user's IP address and makes it difficult for the internet service provider and third parties to track the user's activities as well as location. Since the encryption takes place in real-time, it makes the data more secure and difficult to steal. Furthermore, even if someone does manage to gain access to the data, it won't be of much value since it is turned into ""gibberish"" by the VPN filter. Since a VPN disguises the user's identity as well as online traffic data it entails certain benefits which are: Secure internet use:VPNs servers act as proxies and prevent the user's location from being ascertained as the demographic data comes from a server from another country than that of the user. Bypassing regional restrictions:Another benefit of using VPNs is that they allow the user to bypass regional restrictions on content. Countries often restrict certain content in their jurisdiction, however, VPN location spoofing allows a user to switch to a server based in another country and ""change"" his location virtually and access the restricted content. Data transfer:With data theft being a key concern in modern times, VPNs also provide a key advantage by providing secure data transfer due to the use of encryption and private servers. Although there are various types of VPNs, it is important to get oneself familiarise with the three primary ones. SSL Companies use SSL VPN when an employee lacks access to the organisation's laptop, personal computer (PC) etc. Implemented via a corresponding hardware box, it requires an HTML-5-capable browser allowing an individual to call up the company's login page. Site-to-site Site-to-site (SSL) VPN hides private intranets — a private network contained within an enterprise — allowing users to access resources via these secure networks. This type of VPN is useful if an individual — having two separate intranets — wants to send files while preventing users of one intranet from accessing the other. They are complex and primarily used by large companies. Client-to-server The use of this type of VPN is similar to a person connecting his home PC to the company with an ""extension cable"" as it allows the employees to connect to the company network. Client-to-server VPNs provision the user not connecting to the internet via his own internet service provider but via the VPN provider. It incorporates improved efficiency and universal access to the company's resources.","science"
"79","Trump, Musk witness SpaceX Starship launch as booster misses landing","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575251-donald-trump-elon-musk-witness-spacex-starships-latest-test-flight","Elon Musk's SpaceX launched its giant Starship rocket to space from Texas on Tuesday, advancing the ship's spaceflight abilities but botching an attempt to bring its booster back to land as US President-elect Donald Trump watched from the company's rocket facilities. The roughly 400-foot-tall (122-meter-tall) rocket system, designed to land astronauts on the moon and ferry crews to Mars, lifted off at 4pm CT from SpaceX's sprawling rocket development site in Boca Chica, Texas. The rocket's 233-foot-tall (71-metre-tall) first-stage booster, called Super Heavy, detached from its second stage, Starship, at roughly 62 kilometres in altitude, sending the craft into space. Super Heavy unexpectedly splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico instead of returning to land, where it was expected to fall into large mechanical arms attached to the tower it launched from. The last-minute diversion to water indicated something went wrong. A live stream separate from SpaceX's and hosted by space blogger Everyday Astronaut showed the Super Heavy booster exploding into a massive fireball on the Gulf horizon after splashing down. Starship last month demonstrated the novel catch-landing method for the first time, achieving a key milestone in its reusable design. Tuesday's catch-landing was supposed to be ""faster/harder,"" Musk had written on social media before the launch. After the October 14 Starship test, Trump was intrigued, fixating on the booster's novel catch-landing technique. ""Did you see the way that sucker landed today?"" he said at a rally that day. The rest of the mission appeared successful. In space, the Starship travelled around Earth for a daytime splashdown in the Indian Ocean roughly an hour later. It re-ignited one of its onboard engines in space for the first time, an early test of its manoeuvrability in space that SpaceX had tried but failed to do in past flights. NASA chief Bill Nelson, who is expected to leave his role once Trump takes office in January, congratulated SpaceX in a post on X and said Starship's in-space engine re-ignition marked ""major progress towards orbital flight."" Trump's attendance signals a deepening alliance with Musk, who stands to benefit from Trump's election victory. The billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is expected to wield extraordinary influence to help his companies and secure favourable government treatment. The world's wealthiest person, Musk was a prominent supporter of Trump's presidential election campaign, appearing with him at rallies and backing him with at least $119 million in political support. ""I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space but simply by lifting off the ground,"" Trump wrote on social media, wishing Musk luck on the launch. Trump on November 13 appointed Musk as co-leader of a new government efficiency project that the SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO has said will rid the federal government of wasteful spending and regulations he has called burdensome. The US Federal Aviation Administration's regulation of commercial rocket launches has been a source of frustration for Musk, who has complained that the agency impedes his company's progress in getting to Mars. But the FAA's license approval of Tuesday's Starship launch a little over a month after the rocket's previous flight was its quickest regulatory turnaround yet for SpaceX, as the agency develops new launch-approval processes meant to keep pace with the US space industry's growth. Musk on Tuesday listed four core objectives for the test flight: restarting Starship's space-tailored engine during flight, making a more visible ocean landing during the daytime - past attempts have been at night - putting Starship through more intense heat during reentry, and making the booster landing faster. ""There are thousands of small design changes also being tested,"" said Musk. SpaceX is eyeing swift advances in Starship development during the second Trump administration. The administration's space agenda is expected to give NASA's Artemis program, which is due to return astronauts to the lunar surface, a greater focus on the more ambitious goal of landing people on Mars, Musk's premier space aspiration. ""We just passed 400 launches on Falcon, and I would not be surprised if we fly 400 Starship launches in the next four years,"" said SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell at the Baron Investment Conference in New York last week, referring to the company's workhorse rocket.","science"

From the company's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas, the Starship mega rocket will launch, reportedSpace.com. Notably, the megarocket consists of two fully reusable elements — a huge first stage called Super Heavy and an upper-stage spacecraft called Starship or simply as ""Ship"". In a statement announcing the sixth test flight, SpaceX officials said: ""The next Starship flight test aims to expand the envelope on ship and booster capabilities and get closer to bringing reuse of the entire system online."" The sixth flight of the Starship follows a successful fifth test flight on October 13. During the previous flight, the Super Heavy Booster was captured using giant metal ""chopstick"" arms upon its return to Starbase, whereas, the upper stage continued in flight before completing a controlled entry and landing maneuver over the Indian Ocean. ""The success of the first catch attempt demonstrated the design feasibility while providing valuable data to continue improving hardware and software performance,"" SpaceX said in the statement. If all goes according to plan, The booster will once again demonstrate a catch landing back at Starbase during Flight 6, which will take place about seven minutes after liftoff if everything goes as per the plan. Moreover, Starship will also perform a series of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for reentry. This includes flying at a higher angle during the final phase of descent before splashing down in the Indian Ocean about 65 minutes post-launch.","science"

The warning comes as nations gather in Azerbaijan for UN climate talks. Forests, oceans, and soils, known as natural carbon sinks, absorb about half of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities. Scientists emphasise that these natural systems are vital for stabilising global temperatures once emissions are slashed to near zero. However, some countries are misusing these sinks to offset ongoing fossil fuel emissions, compromising their ability to address past carbon buildup. Oxford University scientist Myles Allen, a key developer of net zero science, highlighted this issue, noting that some nations, like Russia, plan to achieve net zero while increasing fossil fuel use, relying heavily on their vast forests. Similarly, the EU has partially counted forest carbon absorption in its emission offsets. The researchers called for a shift to ""geological net zero,"" where every tonne of CO2 emitted from fossil fuels is captured and stored permanently underground. Currently, only 0.1% of global emissions are captured in this way, far from the 100% target needed by 2050. Without clearer rules and robust technology adoption, the world risks overshooting 1.5°C and potentially surpassing 2°C, with warming continuing. This warning follows predictions that 2024 will break records for carbon emissions and temperatures.","science"
"82","IT industry can't function without VPN, says PTA amid govt's curbs","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574995-it-industry-cant-function-without-vpn-says-pta-amid-govts-curbs","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman Major General (retd) Hafeezur Rehman on Monday acknowledged the importance of virtual private network (VPN), saying that industry cannot function without it. The PTA chairman made the remarks while briefing the Senate standing committee on Information Technology and Telecommunications as the regulatory authority, earlier today, extended the deadline for the registration of VPNs until November 30. The extension came rising concerns over the misuse of unauthorised VPNs for activities such as bypassing internet restrictions and accessing prohibited content. Briefing the Senate body, the PTA chairman urged people associated with IT business to register their VPNs to avoid any inconvenience. The PTA chairman was of the view that the “common man needs VPN” amid the looming ban on the private gateways. “Freelancers and companies required VPNs.” VPN registration policy was introduced in 2016, he told the lawmakers, adding that they recently launched a campaign in this regard. “Internet will never be shut down if VPN is registered.” The PTA chairman said: “Whenever the internet has to be shut down, the industry suffers.” He apprised the lawmakers that 25,000 VPNs have been registered so far, adding that the PTA had blocked over 0.5 million obscene websites. Stressing the need for registration of illegal encrypted networks, the PTA chairman said: “20 million Pakistanis attempted to access obscene websites last Sunday.” It is pertinent to mention here that the “virtual tunnel” is widely used to access content that may be inaccessible or blocked for internet users. “VPN are not blocked so far in the country,” he added. Last week, the Interior Ministry asked the PTA to block “illegal VPNs” across Pakistan, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”. For his part, legal member from the IT Ministry apprised the lawmakers that they were not asked about the VPN shutdown. At this, PML-N Senator Afnan Ullah asked if VPN issue can be dealt under Peca Act. The legal member, however, replied in negative. The senator asked if VPN is a “tool, then how can the interior ministry can give instructions in this regard”. The legal member told the Senator that it makes access to social media possible. “Law does not allow you to block VPNs,” remarked the senator. To another query about internet shutdown in Balochistan, the member said: “Internet of white-listed companies will never be shut down. The PTA chairman said that internet services in the province were suspended on the request of Interior Ministry in the backdrop of a security operation. The lawmakers expressed their displeasure over the interior ministry’s directions, saying that “Then, smartphones, computers and other devices should also be shut down.” Starting from December 1, the PTA will initiate a nationwide crackdown on unregistered VPNs, said sources. A successful trial of VPN blocking has already been conducted, and a second trial is planned in the coming days to ensure readiness for the full-scale shutdown, they added. The development came as Pakistan has recorded a surge in use of VPNs since February this year as the authorities banned social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter over national security ""concerns"". Entities such as software houses, call centres, banks, embassies and freelancers can now easily register their VPNs online through the PTA’s official website: www.pta.gov.pk. The Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) members can also avail this facility. Registration involves completing an online form and providing basic details, including CNIC, company registration details and taxpayer status. Freelancers must submit documentation, such as a letter or email, verifying their project or company association. Additionally, applicants must provide the IP address for VPN connectivity. If a fixed IP address is required, it can be acquired from an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The registration process is free, and approvals are typically granted within 8-10 hours of submission. To-date, more than 20,000 companies and freelancers have successfully registered their VPNs through this process. Any individual requiring a VPN for commercial purposes can apply under the ‘Freelancer’ category and needs to provide the required information, including supporting evidence from the employer. The VPNs are widely used globally to bypass restricted content and safeguard user privacy. Reports suggest that Pakistanis make up to 20 million daily attempts to access blocked explicit content using unregistered VPNs, despite government restrictions.","science"
"83","How is Bluesky different from Elon Musk's X?","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574943-how-is-bluesky-different-from-elon-musks-x","As discontent with Elon Musk’s social media platform X (formerly Twitter) grows, users are increasingly turning to the platform's former owner Jack Dorsey's Bluesky. Critics of X have raised concerns about content moderation practices, especially following Musk's involvement with the United States President-elect Donald Trump's government and the reinstatement of accounts banned for hate speech. But why have users chosen Bluesky over X? According toThe Economic Times, in contrast with X, Bluesky is a decentralised microblogging platform that promotes user privacy and control. The platform, which is now led by CEO Jay Graber after Dorsey stepped down in May 2024, aims to offer a refreshing alternative to users, branding itself as ""social media as it should be"". The platform features a user-friendly interface reminiscent of early Twitter while capitalising on a decentralised architecture for enhanced security and autonomy. The platform remained invite-only until early 2024, allowing developers to refine its features. It is structured as a public benefit corporation, focusing on aligning its operations with user interests and improving the overall social media experience. Although Bluesky allows users to post short messages, photos, and videos and send direct messages, its defining feature is its decentralised framework, enabling data storage on independent servers rather than centralised company-owned servers. This innovative architecture enables users to join or establish servers that reflect their community values. Unlike X, which relies on algorithm-driven feeds, Bluesky limits visible content to posts from user's followed accounts. This straightforward, user-centric approach has attracted individuals frustrated with X's complex feed mechanics and overwhelming content. The sudden switch to Bluesky from X by users comes amid significant political shifts and user dissatisfaction with the Musk-owned platform. Meanwhile, organisations likeThe Guardianhave criticised the platform for fostering toxicity.  Additionally, Bluesky’s top-ranking status in app stores and endorsements by celebrities have further boosted its visibility.","science"

The Meta-owned instant messaging app is set to roll out a feature to animate some confetti emoji reactions for the New Year, and it's available to some beta testers who download the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.24.17 update from the Google Play Store. According toWABetaInfo, with the upcoming update, users will be able to explore a new animation when reacting to messages using some festive-themed emojis. Specifically, the Party Popper, Partying Face, and Confetti Ball emojis will trigger vibrant animations designed to enhance the celebratory mood as the world approaches the New Year, a period often associated with celebrations and festive messages. Emojis that symbolise joy and festivity are expected to see widespread use during this season and WhatsApp is preparing for it by adding a delightful cosmetic touch to its reactions. When users react to a chat message choosing one of the emojis, it triggers an engaging graphic effect: colourful confetti bursts out of the emoji, creating a lively animation, making interactions more fun and expressive. It's worth noting that this feature is available only to selected beta testers, but it is expected to be rolled out to all users soon, just in time for the upcoming New Year celebrations.","science"

The platform recently hit 16.7 million users. But what sets Bluesky apart, and why is it attracting so much attention? Bluesky resembles X in functionality and design, offering features like posting, commenting, and liking content. However, its distinguishing feature is decentralisation, allowing users to host their data on independent servers rather than company-owned ones. While most users adopt a standard username ending in “.bsky.social,” Bluesky also supports custom domains, offering additional personalisation. Founded in 2019 by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was initially envisioned as a decentralised version of Twitter. However, Dorsey stepped down from the board in May 2024 and deleted his account in September. Today, the platform is led by CEO Jay Graber and operates as a US public benefit corporation. Bluesky’s rise coincides with significant political shifts and user dissatisfaction with X. Elon Musk's alignment with Donald Trump’s administration has prompted many to leave X in protest, while organisations like *The Guardian* have criticised the platform for fostering toxicity. Additionally, Bluesky’s top-ranking status in app stores and endorsements by celebrities such as Lizzo and Ben Stiller have further boosted its visibility. Unlike X, Bluesky avoids traditional advertising, exploring paid services like custom domain usernames. As its user base grows, Bluesky may consider broader revenue streams, such as subscription models, to sustain operations. Bluesky’s current growth is impressive but falls short of X’s daily active user base, estimated at 250 million. Its financial viability remains uncertain, echoing challenges faced by its predecessor.","science"

A cargo rocket carrying brick samples blasted off late Friday for the Tiangong space station, part of Beijing's mission to put humans on the Moon by 2030 and build a permanent base there by 2035. ""China launched the cargo craft Tianzhou-8 from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Centre on Friday night to deliver supplies for its orbiting Tiangong space station,"" state news agencyXinhuasaid, citing China's space agency. Construction of a Moon base is a daunting task: any structure has to withstand huge amounts of cosmic radiation, extreme temperature variations and moonquakes, and getting building materials there in the first place is a costly procedure. Building the base out of the Moon itself could be a solution to those problems, scientists from a university in central Wuhan province hope. They have created a series of prototype bricks made of various compositions of materials found on Earth, such as basalt, which mimic the properties of lunar soil. Slivers of those test bricks will be subjected to a series of stringent tests once they reach the space station. ""It's mainly exposure,"" said Zhou Cheng, a professor at Wuhan's Huazhong University of Science and Technology. ""To put it simply, we put (the material) in space and let it sit there... to see whether its durability, its performance will degrade under the extreme environment."" The temperature on the Moon can vary drastically between 180 and -190 degrees Celsius (356 to -310 degrees Fahrenheit). Its lack of an atmosphere means it is subjected to large quantities of cosmic radiation as well as micrometeorites, while moonquakes can weaken any structure on its surface. The exposure experiment will last three years, with samples sent back for testing every year.","science"

""Since Elon Musk took over, the platform has increasingly merged with his and Donald Trump's political ambitions,"" said editor-in-chief Peter Wolodarski. Already on Wednesday, Britain's centre-left dailyThe Guardianhad announced it would no longer post content from its official accounts on X, which it called ""toxic"". A day later, Spain's Vanguardia did the same, saying it would rather lose subscribers than remain on a ""disinformation network"". Several users had already wondered back in 2022 whether they should remain on Twitter when Musk — a businessman best known for running car company Tesla and space company SpaceX — bought the platform and drastically reduced content moderation in the name of free speech. The question has flared up again since Trump won this month's presidential election, actively supported by Musk. ""I would expect more publishers to part ways with X,"" said Stephen Barnard, a specialist on media manipulation at Butler University in the US. ""How many do so will likely depend on what actions X, Musk, and the Trump administration take with regard to media and journalism,"" he said.

The European Commission said the US tech titan also abused its dominant position by imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers that advertise on its platforms. “This is illegal under EU anti-trust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour,” the bloc’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement. Meta said it would appeal, alleging the decision ignored “the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services. “Facebook users can choose whether or not to engage with Marketplace, and many don’t.

The new Gemini app will include Gemini Live, a voice-based feature that allows users to have natural conversations with the chatbot. Apple has already said it will incorporate OpenAI's ChatGPT into a refreshed version of its voice assistant, Siri. ""It’s great for when you want to practice for an upcoming interview, ask for advice on things to do in a new city, or brainstorm and develop creative ideas,"" Brian Marquardt, a senior director of product management at Google, said in a statement. Gemini is Google's answer to ChatGPT, the popular application developed by Microsoft MSFT.O-backed OpenAI. Google initially launched it in February 2023 under the name Bard, and has since added more capabilities while weathering controversies. Google announced the voice feature during an August event and first added it to phones powered by its own mobile operating system, Android. Technical advances in AI spurred by the rise of large language models have fostered the emergence of a new generation of voice assistants far more capable than Amazon's Alexa AMZN.O, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant. Google's Gemini Live is a replacement of Assistant, an eight-year-old product built using older AI technology. Hundreds of employees on the Voice Assistant team were laid off in January as part of a reorganisation to ""become more efficient,"" a company spokesperson said at the time. Google has since consolidated further. Last month it folded the Gemini app team into DeepMind, its AI research lab, in a move that CEO Sundar Pichai also attributed to increasing efficiency.

However, WhatsApp is now planning to introduce vibrant colours to these icons, making it easier to visually identify contacts and groups at a glance, as users will begin to associate specific colours with certain chats. It's worth noting that the concept of this feature is very similar to the coloured icons seen in the address book of the Android stock app, where each contact is visually distinguished by a colour-coded icon. When a contact has not set a profile picture or has chosen to hide it due to privacy settings, WhatsApp will automatically display a distinct themed icon for that contact. This default icon includes unique visual characteristics, particularly in its colour scheme, allowing users to quickly distinguish between contacts who may have identical names or simply lack a photo. Similarly, in the case of group chats and communities, the new themed icons may also help when groups do not have a designated image. Without a unique group picture, it can be complicated to differentiate between multiple group chats at a glance who share the same name. The themed icons will apply distinct colours and designs that help users associate a particular icon with each group, making it easier to recognise without needing to open each group chat individually. This new feature is currently under development.

African elephant populations fall by 77%: report","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574266-african-savanna-elephant-populations-fall-by-nearly-70-report","A new study has has revealed an alarming population decline in African elephant populations across numerous sites on the continent over approximately half a century,Reutersreported. On Monday, researchers revealed what they described as the most comprehensive assessment to date of the two African elephant species — the savanna elephant and the forest elephant — using population survey data from 475 sites in 37 countries between 1964 and 2016. The study found that savanna elephant populations fell by about 70% on average at the surveyed sites, while forest elephant populations dropped by about 90%, with poaching and habitat loss as the main drivers. Overall, there was an average population decrease of 77% across the surveyed sites for both species. In some areas, elephants disappeared entirely, while in others, populations grew thanks to conservation efforts. “A lot of the lost populations won’t come back, and many low-density populations face continued pressures. We will likely lose more populations in the future,” said George Wittemyer, a professor of wildlife conservation at Colorado State University and chair of the scientific board of the conservation group Save the Elephants. Wittemyer co-led the study, which was published in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Poaching, which typically involves the killing of elephants for their tusks, has been driven largely by demand for ivory in China and other parts of Asia. Habitat loss is primarily due to agricultural expansion. The population of forest elephants is estimated to be about a third of that of savanna elephants. Forest elephants have been disproportionately affected by poaching, which has devastated populations of both species in northern and eastern Africa. “We have lost a number of elephant populations across many countries, but the northern Sahel region of Africa — for instance, in Mali, Chad, and Nigeria — has been particularly hard hit. High pressure and limited protection have resulted in the extirpation of these populations,” Wittemyer said. In southern Africa, however, elephant populations rose at 42% of the surveyed sites. ""We have seen real success in parts of Africa, particularly in southern Africa, where there has been significant growth in populations in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Namibia. For populations showing positive trends, active stewardship and management by governments or outside groups have been key,” Wittemyer said. The study did not attempt a continent-wide population tally, as the various surveys used different methodologies over different timeframes to estimate local elephant densities, making a unified count unfeasible. Instead, it assessed population trends at each site surveyed. A separate conservationist-led estimate put the combined population of the two species between 415,000 and 540,000 elephants as of 2016, the last year covered by the study period, which remains the most recent comprehensive continent-wide estimate. “The loss of large mammals is a significant ecological issue for Africa and the planet,” said conservation ecologist and study co-author Dave Balfour, a research associate in the Centre for African Conservation Ecology at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa. The slightly smaller Asian elephant, the world's third extant elephant species, faces its own population crisis, impacted by similar factors as African elephants. While Wittemyer acknowledged the grim trends, he also highlighted the importance of recognising successful conservation efforts. ""Learning how and where we can be successful in conserving elephants is as important as acknowledging the severity of their decline."" He added, “African elephants are not only among the most sentient and intelligent species we share the planet with but also play a crucial ecological role. They maintain the balance between forest and grasslands, disperse seeds, and support a multitude of other species that depend on them for survival.”","science"

""We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives,"" the left-leaning newspaper, which has nearly 11 million followers on X, said in a statement on its website. It added that its ""resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere"". ""This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism,"" the statement noted. ""The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse."" The paper's main X handle — @guardian — was still accessible on Wednesday but a message on it advised ""this account has been archived"" while redirecting visitors to its website. The Guardian noted that X users would still be able to share its articles, and that it would still ""occasionally embed content from X"" within its articles given ""the nature of live news reporting"". It also said its reporters would still be able to use the site and other social networks on which the paper does not have an account. ""Social media can be an important tool for news organisations and help us to reach new audiences but, at this point, X now plays a diminished role in promoting our work,""The Guardian added. Musk purchased X, formerly known as Twitter, for $44 billion in 2022 and has consistently courted controversy with his use of the platform, particularly during the recent US presidential election. Musk endorsed Donald Trump and used his personal account boasting nearly 205 million followers to sway voters in favour of the Republican, with a slew of incendiary, misleading posts criticised for cranking up the political temperature. Trump on Tuesday announced that the Tesla and SpaceX billionaire would lead a so-called Department of Government Efficiency in his incoming administration, alongside the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.","science"

"99","WhatsApp set to revamp muting feature for group chat notifications","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574166-whatsapp-set-to-revamp-muting-feature-for-group-chat-notifications","WhatsApp is set to revamp its feature for muting notifications from group chats in an upcoming update, making it simpler for users to better understand how this feature works. According toWABetaInfo, the Meta-owned instant messaging app's new feature allows users to choose between receiving notifications for all group messages or only for those marked as ""Highlights"", which include mentions, replies, and other direct interactions. With this option, users can limit notifications to only those interactions that specifically engage or mention them instead of being notified for every message in group chats. The new feature will make it easier for users to prioritise important messages, especially in large group chats where message volume can become overwhelming. It is important to note that this behaviour has been the default for years. Currently, WhatsApp users may experience confusion when muting a group chat as they may still receive notifications for mentions and direct replies. However, the app now explicitly outlines that muting a group chat can still allow notifications for mentions and replies to prevent confusion and enhance user control. Additionally, the default notification setting for new group members is determined by the group size. As a result, larger groups will automatically default to sending notifications only for ""Highlights"", which means users will only be notified about direct interactions. Meanwhile, users in smaller groups may continue to receive notifications for all messages by default when they join, unless they choose to modify this setting. The revamped feature is set to be rolled out in an upcoming update but beta testers can currently explore this feature by downloading the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.24.10 update from the Google Play Store. It will be rolled out to even more people over the coming weeks.","science"

According to an unofficial news leak as cited byGadgets 360, the development of a new feature is still under process. Similar features might be introduced on Facebook and WhatsApp as well. Developer Alessandro Paluzzi initially shared the information on Threads, posting a screenshot of the menu where an option of ‘Create an AI profile picture’ can be seen under his profile picture on Instagram’s profile picture setting page. With insufficient clarity surrounding the new feature, it is difficult to predict the exact way this feature would work but it will presumably be supported by one of Meta's Llama large language models (LLMs). However, this feature will not be Instagram’s first AI-driven specification as the platform has already incorporated an AI chatbot called Meta AI which allows users to interact with the chatbot and generate images based on text prompts. Besides, Instagram Head Adam Mosseri announced that the app abandoned the service of automated feed refreshing upon opening after a certain period of time. Moreover, Meta recently unveiled its ongoing tests of an AI-driven facial recognition tool designed to combat scam ads across Facebook and Instagram. This technology aims to identify and block ads that exploit images of public figures to mislead users. Additionally, Meta disclosed plans to use facial recognition for verifying users via video selfies, offering a secure method for users to regain access to compromised accounts. Currently, both of these features remain in limited testing phases and are not yet widely accessible.","science"

In a letter to the top telecommunication regulator, the Religious affairs ministry expressed concerns over Pakistan becoming “one of the leading countries in terms of viewing pornographic content, which is highly alarming, especially in light of its negative impact on public morality and the well-being of our society”. “Despite the proactive measures taken by the PTA to block such content in line with the Supreme Court orders issued in January 2016, May 2016, and March 2018, it has been observed that pornographic and blasphemous material is still readily accessible on multiple online platforms,” it added. Acknowledging the PTA's efforts to curb this issue by blocking the accessibility of such content, the ministry noted that such material ""is still online accessible that violates our cultural and religious values"". “The widespread availability of such content undermines efforts to protect citizens, particularly young people, from exposure to harmful material. It also raises concerns regarding the adherence to the directives of the top court and the authority's ability to effectively enforce content regulations.” Given the sensitivity of the matter, the ministry asked the PTA to take measures to block and restrict access to pornographic, blasphemous, and other harmful online content at the earliest timeframe. “An early and prompt action is requested,” it concluded.","science"

The first celestial event stargazers may look forward to this week is the brighter Northern Taurid meteor shower which is expected to illuminate the night skies with ""fireballs"" that can be seen most nights. This event will be followed by the final ""supermoon"" of the year, a guest appearance from Uranus in areas with minimal light pollution and the Leonid meteor shower. The Northern Taurid meteor shower is expected to peak overnight between November 11 and 12, around midnight. However, this is not a major event, with about five ""shooting stars"" per hour. As a result, sightings may occur throughout the week but may not be well-defined. Despite a bright moon affecting their visibility, Taurids are known for their bright ""fireballs"", as a result of dust and debris left by Comet 2P/Encke in the solar system. The Beaver supermoon, also known as the 'Frost Moon' and 'Mourning Moon', will be the 11th and penultimate full moon of 2024, set to shine on Saturday (November 16). Although it is classified as a supermoon, it will be the third-smallest of the year's four ""supermoons"". For a spectacular view, watch it rise in the east-northeast, where you may also spot Saturn to the left of the full moon. The planet Uranus is also set to reach opposition by Saturday when the Earth’s orbit takes it between the seventh planet and the sun. This event leads to shorter distances between the planets, making Uranus appear brighter for several weeks. It rises in the east at sunset, shining at a magnitude of +5.6, making it potentially visible to the naked eye in dark skies. However, a telescope is recommended for better observation. The Leonid meteor shower is expected to produce about 15 meteors per hour after midnight on Sunday (November 17), concluding this week's celestial events. However, viewers should temper their expectations, as a recent full supermoon will brighten the night sky, making it difficult to see the meteors clearly, despite the shower's potential for over 100 meteors per hour at its peak.","science"

The new experiences were unveiled in time for the Catholic Church's Holy Year or Jubilee celebrations in 2025, which come around every quarter of a century. ""St. Peter's is like a starry sky on a summer night: you remain enchanted by its splendour,"" said St Peter's archpriest Cardinal Mauro Gambetti,  enthusing that the new tools would act like a telescope or spaceship for better viewing. Working with tech firm Microsoft and Iconem, a company that specialises in the digitalisation of heritage sites, the Vatican launched a new interactive website, a digital replica of the basilica and two AI-enabled exhibitions. Some 40,000-50,000 people visit the Basilica daily. A 3D model of St. Peter's was built by scanning the basilica using drones,  cameras and lasers. AI algorithms pieced together, elaborated and completed the data. Drones flew at night for 4 weeks, taking over 400,000 photographs and collecting the equivalent of a 6 km-high column of DVDs in data. Data from the digital twin will also be instrumental in preservation and restoration work.

The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has now more than doubled from the year's low of $38,505 and was last at $82,236, having earlier touched a record high of $82,527. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. ""Bitcoin's Trump-pump is alive and well... with Republicans on the cusp of taking the house to confirm a red wave in Congress, it seems the crypto crowd are betting on digital-currency deregulation,"" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, referring to Republican control of both houses. While Simpson warned that Trump's near-term priorities will likely lie elsewhere, crypto investors see an end to stepped-up scrutiny under US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler whom Trump has said he will fire. The cryptocurrency industry spent over $119 million backing pro-crypto congressional candidates, many of whom won their races. In Ohio, one of the crypto industry's biggest foes in Congress - Senate  Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown - was ousted, while pro-crypto candidates from both the Democratic and Republican parties won in  Michigan, West Virginia, Indiana, Alabama and North Carolina. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his interest in the sector as a friendly signal. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Eric Trump, one of the president-elect's sons and executive vice president of his private conglomerate, The Trump Organization, is a keynote speaker at a Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi next month, according to the event organisers. ""The incoming Trump administration may lead to expedited regulatory clarity, enhanced institutional participation, improved market infrastructure,  and broader mainstream adoption,"" Deutsche Bank research analyst Marion  Laboure said. ""Trump's pragmatic approach marks a clear departure from recent regulatory restrictions."" Flows into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also picked up since Trump's election win. On Thursday, Nov. 7, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest inflows on record, drawing a net $1.38 billion, according to data from Citigroup. ""There have been significant inflows across the board,"" Citi analysts said in a note. ""ETF inflows have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns, and we expect this to continue in the near term,"" they added. Gains in cryptocurrencies have been broad. Ether rose above $3,200 for the first time in over three months over the weekend and was last fetching  $3,182. Dogecoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that began as a satirical critique of the 2013 crypto frenzy, was at a three-year high. US-listed cryptocurrency stocks surged in premarket trading with crypto exchange Coinbase Global jumping more than 16%, and iShares Bitcoin Trust, up 7.3%. Crypto miner Riot Platforms surged over 10%, while MicroStrategy, one of Bitcoin's biggest corporate backers, gained 11.3%. Deutsche Bank's Laboure also expects rate cuts from the Federal Reserve to create a supportive environment for the cryptocurrency market.","science"

Sources within the PTA said that the unregistered VPNs pose a significant security risk, as they may allow unauthorised access to sensitive data. These could also potentially provide access to illegal content as well, they added. Insiders further stated the government is also temporarily blocking some VPNs to allow for their inclusion in the PTA’s white-listing process. The telecommunication authorities initiated the VPN registration process back in 2010. To date, approximately 20,500 VPNs have been successfully registered, with over 1,422 companies having completed the registration process. The regulatory body is now focused on accelerating the white-listing of VPNs to improve compliance. Consumers have been facing difficulties in accessing free VPN services for several hours, with many reporting disruptions in their ability to use VPNs for secure browsing. PTA officials assured that action is being taken to streamline the process and prevent illegal use of VPNs in the country. VPNs are commonly used worldwide to bypass restricted content. In Pakistan, for instance, citizens have used VPNs to access the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) which has been banned for several months. The government stated it would not lift the restriction on X unless it formally registers in Pakistan. A report published inThe Newson Monday stated that more than two dozen VPNs were temporarily blocked by the government during a six-hour trial of firewall on Sunday, which marked a significant step in internet regulation in the country. The temporary blockage — that took place between 4pm and 10pm — was the first instance where a government firewall noticeably impacted internet users across the country. The PTA has urged businesses — including IT companies, software houses, freelancers and banks — to register their IPs for continued VPN access, ensuring uninterrupted internet services for authorised users. Those registering must provide their intended use and specify their business activities.","science"

The temporary blockage — that took place between 4pm and 10pm — was the first instance where a government firewall noticeably impacted internet users across the country,The Newsreported. Both the premium VPN services and locally accessed VPNs experienced outages, according to a government official familiar with the details. ""The trial blockage of over 20 VPNs at once was successful, although our current infrastructure struggles to handle the load,"" commented an insider, revealing challenges in sustaining such controls. The VPN restrictions were lifted, according to an executive of telecom industry, due to backlash from businesses, which rely on VPNs for secure and efficient communication. Moving forward, all unregistered VPN users could face potential blocks as the government bolsters its firewall capabilities. In response to rumours circulating in September regarding VPN restrictions, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) had clarified that it didn’t intend to block VPNs. Nevertheless, it urged businesses — including IT companies, software houses, freelancers and banks — to register their IPs for continued VPN access, ensuring uninterrupted internet services for authorised users.

Skynet-1A, a satellite that was launched into space in 1969 soon after man's first lunar landing, and was originally positioned over East Africa to facilitate British military communications. However, recently, it was found by scientists to have relocated and hovering above the Americas, far from its expected trajectory over the Indian Ocean, theDaily Expressreported. What scientists found baffling about this was that they had no clear explanation of who moved it or how. According to the scientists, orbital mechanics suggest that a half-tonne satellite shouldn't drift that far on its own which leads to the conclusion that it was intentionally moved. Nobody can say who would want or be able to do such a thing. But is the satellite's relocation a good thing or a bad thing? Space consultant Dr Stuart Eves told theBBC: ""It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours. “It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105° West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis. ""Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite, we're still responsible for it. The satellite was made in the United States and put in space by a US Air Force (USAF) Delta rocket. Thanks to veterans of the programme that put it in space, the satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity and allowed London to communicate securely with British forces, such as Singapore. Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has reviewed documents and believes that plausible explanations exist for how the satellite has arrived at its present location. She said: ""A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?”","science"

Notably, such maneuvers are routine for the orbital lab, requiring periodic boosts to maintain its altitude above Earth and prevent its orbital decay into the planet's atmosphere, reportedSpace. Previously, this has been achieved with the help of Russia's Soyuz and Progress vehicles, and other spacecraft. However, it has now been performed by SpaceX's Dragon for the first time. A symbolic beginning of the end for the ISS has been marked by this milestone. Moreover, Dragon isn't the first US-built spacecraft to lend its fuel to the space station's orbit as Nasa tested an ISS orbit reboost with the assistance of a Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo vehicle in 2022. The way for a catastrophic ""un-boosting"" of the space station's orbit will ultimately be paved by the data from Dragon’s reboost. Additionally, the ISS has been in continuous use and occupancy for almost 25 years now. Through the end of this decade, Nasa has projected the ISS’s viability.

US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California rejected accusations on Thursday that Zuckerberg directed Meta's efforts to conceal from children the serious mental health risks of using Facebook and Instagram. The plaintiffs called Meta's billionaire co-founder the ""guiding spirit"" behind alleged concealment efforts, saying he ignored repeated internal warnings about the risks and publicly downplayed them. But the judge found a lack of specifics about what Zuckerberg did wrong, and said ""control of corporate activity alone is insufficient"" to establish liability. Her decision does not affect related claims against Meta itself. The plaintiffs brought claims under the laws of 13 US states: Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Although the Meta-owned instant messaging app's new feature will be rolled out in an upcoming update, it is currently accessible only to beta testers who download WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.23.23 update from the Google Play Store. The new feature allows users to manage their chat lists. Specifically, users can finally delete some preset filters, such as the ""Unread"" or ""Groups"" filters, directly from the chat interface,WABetaInforeported. With the previous update, these default lists could not be deleted, as they are considered essential filters for organising conversations within the app. However, WhatsApp finally allows users to remove these preset filters if users don't find them useful and it is quite simple. All you have to do is tapping and holding on a preset filter. Then, a new option to delete it from their list will appear which users may select to get rid of preset filters and customise their interface according to their needs. It is worth noting that once a default filter is removed, it won't be permanently deleted, as users can restore it at any time by selecting it from a set of available preset lists in the settings. This new feature can be especially convenient for users who prefer a minimalist interface and prefer to reduce visual clutter. For example, users who rarely use the list to filter group chats can now delete it, allowing their custom lists or frequently used filters to take priority at the top of the chats tab. This customisation option can also be valuable for business users who want to prioritise chats differently. For example, a business might focus more on customer-specific lists or order-related conversations, so removing filters that don't align with these priorities can simplify the interface. This feature is available to some beta testers but it is rolling out to even more people over the coming weeks.","science"

Apple's stock rose 2.1% on Thursday, leaving it with a market value of $3.44 trillion. The S&P 500 technology index has surged over 4% in the two sessions since Trump won the election on Tuesday. Nvidia has been the US stock market's biggest winner from a race between Microsoft, Alphabet and other heavyweights to build out their AI computing capacity and dominate the emerging technology. The Silicon Valley chip designer's stock has climbed 12% in November, with its value tripling so far in 2024. Following this year's surge, Nvidia now exceeds the combined value of Eli Lilly, Walmart, JPMorgan, Visa, UnitedHealth Group and Netflix. Analysts on average see Nvidia increasing its quarterly revenue by over 80% to $32.9 billion when it reports its results on Nov. 20, according to LSEG. In June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalisations have been neck-and-neck for several months. Microsoft's market value stood at nearly $3.16 trillion, with its stock up 1.25% on Thursday.","science"

According toWABetaInfo, the upcoming update will feature a new interactive sticker feature that will introduce prompts through status updates. The Meta-owned instant messaging app is exploring the implementation of a new ""Add Yours"" sticker for status updates that will allow users to create interactive challenges or prompts, encouraging their contacts to share their own content in response. Similar to the ""Add Yours"" sticker available on Instagram, this feature will let users set a theme, question, or activity that others can participate in by sharing their own status updates. For example, users could create a prompt asking their contacts to share a picture of their pet through a status update, and their contacts will be able to tap the sticker and contribute their own related updates. However, one of the differences compared to the Instagram sticker is the focus on privacy. If a user sees a status update with the ""Add Yours"" sticker and participates by sharing their own content, the audience of the user who shared the update won't see who initiated the chain or what was shared by others who contributed. This is thanks to the end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp status updates as it ensures that such interactions are kept private and limited to the audience the user has selected in their privacy settings This new sticker will allow users to engage with their contacts beyond simple text updates or images, promoting more dynamic interactions. By using the ""Add Yours"" sticker, people will be able to initiate trends, share personal stories, or simply bring a bit of fun and spontaneity to their user experience in the future. Although this feature and under development and is set to be introduced in a future update, users of the app's beta version can explore this feature by downloading the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.23.21 update, which is available on the Google Play Store.","science"

""Social media is harming our kids and I'm calling time on it,"" Albanese told a news conference. He added that legislation will be introduced into parliament this year and will come into effect 12 months after it is ratified by lawmakers. There will be no exemptions for users who have parental consent. ""The onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access,"" Albanese said. ""The onus won't be  on parents or young people."" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said platforms impacted would include Meta Platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Bytedance's TikTok and Elon Musk's X. Alphabet's YouTube would likely also fall within the scope of the legislation, she added. All four companies impacted were not immediately reachable for comment. Several countries have already vowed to curb social media use by children through legislation, though Australia's policy is one of the most stringent. France last year proposed a ban on social media for those under 15, though users were able to avoid the ban with parental consent. The United States has for decades required technology companies to seek parental consent to access the data of children under 13, leading to most social media platforms banning those under that age from accessing their services.","science"

Three fifths of the workforce reported tight deadlines and two fifths had to work at high speed, among the largest proportions in Europe, while only a third could choose the pace at which they worked, the report, opens new tab said. The report was produced for the Commission for Healthier Working Lives — a body set up by Britain's Health Foundation think tank with trade union representation — to improve working conditions required in new employment legislation. ""Problem areas to prioritise now are long hours, work intensity and a lack of control or work autonomy,"" wrote one of the report's authors, Jonny Gifford, principal research fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies. Another co-author, former IES chief Tony Wilson, left the body in October to become a senior advisor to Britain's labour ministry. Some businesses are nervous about the new government's direction of travel. On Monday the Confederation of British Industry warned that tighter employment rules risked exacerbating problems caused by a steep rise in social security taxes and the minimum wage which it predicts will reduce employment, pay and longer-term investment in the economy. The report said that conditions varied between sectors and were generally worse in construction, transport, warehouses, retail and hospitality. Among professional roles, nurses and teachers reported particular strain. Much of the data came from a 2021 European Union survey of working conditions. Britons reported above-average relations with colleagues and managers, but fared more poorly otherwise. ""On nearly every measure the UK ranks among the worst in Europe for workplace demands, control at work and job strain,"" the report said, adding that around half of Britons said they were exhausted from work. Stress at work had increased over the past 25 years, the report added. ""Considering the UK's lower labour productivity compared to peers such as France and Germany, these conditions do not seem justifiable on performance grounds,"" it concluded.","business"

A senior official of the Energy Ministry has told the publication that the cut in gas flows was aimed at lowering the line pack pressure in the national gas transmission system. Companies including the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), Mari Petroleum, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and MOL have time again warned the authorities that the practice of decreasing local gas outflows to safeguard the gas transmission system was perilous. The E&P companies, according to officials, argued that sometimes those wells nearing depletion, if compelled to reduce natural gas flows, would cause irreparable damage and the wells cannot be recharged to their original flow levels. ""They require capital-intensive investment through artificial lift methods to resume production,"" noted the officials. In the past many wells braved huge damages because of a reduction in their gas outflows and they could not be recharged this is how many E&P companies braved mammoth losses, which according to the stats is over Rs50 billion in the period 2021-24. The Sui Northern started reducing the gas outflows from local gas fields by 200mmcfd from November 13, 2024, which have now further been reduced by 285mmcf, making the gas fields vulnerable. There are chances that many wells may not be recovered with the same volume of gas with the required pressure. As of yesterday, the latest data available withThe Newsregarding the reduction of gas outflows shows the system has reduced the intake of gas by 90 mmcfd from Sui gas field of Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), 22mmcfd from Qadirpur gas field of OGDCL, 48mmcfd from HRL/ Ghazij gas field of Mari Petroleum Company Limited, 15mmcfd from Tough field of OGDCL, 50mmcfd from MOL field of MOL, 45mmcfd from Nashpa, 4mmcfd from Tolang field of MOL and 11mmcfd from Dhok Hussain field of OGDCL. The main gas pipeline in the country is now working as storage of the gas instead of being used for transportation and distribution services just because gas consumption has reduced manifold in the country, particularly by the power sector. The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) says the power sector is continuously consuming less re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) against the allocation. This situation has led to high system pack/pressures across the entire transmission network. Mitigation steps are being taken accordingly. It further said the Power Division has reduced the gas outflows from the local gas fields by 285mmcf per day until now, starting by 200mmcf from November 13, 2024. However, the data shows that the line pack pressure is not being reduced as the power sector has further reduced the intake of imported gas for power generation to just 174mmcf. The SNGPL says the power sector is continuously consuming less RLNG against the allocation. This situation has led to high system pack/pressures across the entire transmission network. Mitigation steps are being taken accordingly. The supplier further said the Power Division has reduced the gas outflows from the local gas fields by 285mmcf per day until now, starting by 200mmcf from November 13, 2024. However, the data shows that the line pack pressure is not being reduced as the power sector has further reduced the intake of imported gas for power generation to just 174mmcf. The government has already managed to shift 5 LNG cargoes to 2026, earlier destined to reach Pakistan in 2025. Pakistan imports 10 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) cargoes (9 from Qatar and one from ENI) every month but the consumption by the power sector has never been as per the demand the Power Division submits for every month. In the pipeline, apart from the imported gas, the country’s local gas is also included. In the wake of high gas tariffs, imported and local gas consumption has reasonably reduced. The Power Division says if it utilises the RLNG power plants at the maximum, the basket price of electricity would increase as the RLNG's cost for power generation is higher, which is at Rs26 per unit. So the power sector prefers to first run the cheaper power plants which consume local gas and coal as fuel. The system also prefers to run nuclear and hydropower plants as their tariffs are on the lower side. Now in November 2024, the electricity demand has decreased as the use of ACs is on the decline, particularly in the upper Punjab and KP and northern parts of the country. The line pack on Sunday (November 24, 2024) was at 5.159bcf which was at 5.174bcf on Saturday. The power sector is consuming 174mmcf of gas for power generation, while the fertilser sector is 92mmcf. The indigenous gas input in this system stayed at just 481mmcf whereas the RLNG input was at 699mmcf out of which 64mmcf has been retained by Sui Southern. The export and non-export industry is using 225mmcf in the system of Sui Southern.","business"

The Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Shares Index gained 281.55 points or 0.29% to close at 98,079.78 points. The apex index surged by 1,519.24 points, or 1.55%, to hit an intraday high of 99,317.47 points after declining by over 600 points right after the opening bell. Muhammad Saad Ali, Director of Research at Intermarket Securities, noted: ""Politics is a major factor in the dip in early trading."" ""Profit-taking kicked in on Friday after the index nearly hit 100,000 points. Additionally, this is the rollover week for futures investors, which could lead to heightened selling activity,"" he added. The market's resilience comes amid heightened political uncertainty and strict security measures in major cities, including Islamabad and Lahore. Market participants attributed the gains to strong fundamentals, improving macroeconomic indicators, and optimism over declining lending rates. Analysts pointed to several factors contributing to the market’s continued rise. Despite these pressures, the market remained optimistic due to declining fixed-income yields, a current account (C/A) surplus of $349 million in October, and positive remarks from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after a recent review. Tahir Abbas, Head of Research & Investment Strategy at Arif Habib Limited, highlighted the market's valuation appeal:  ""The valuation is extremely attractive. In the current scenario of declining interest rates, fixed-income returns are becoming completely unattractive and are expected to fall into single digits.” ""Additionally, a major reason for this positive sentiment is that as long as our macroeconomic indicators remain stable or improve, the market will continue to maintain positive momentum,"" he added. Earlier in the month the SBP cut its key policy rate by a record 250 basis points to 15%, further cuts are expected with falling inflation numbers. Among the notable developments, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) raised Rs350 billion in an auction of Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), where yields fell up to 19 basis points. The government raised Rs350 billion through the auction of Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), exceeding the target of Rs300 billion, with yields on five-year and 10-year papers falling to their lowest levels since March 2022. The cut-off yield for the two-year zero-coupon bond decreased by 19 basis points (bps) to 13.0%. Meanwhile, the cut-off yield for the three-year bond remained unchanged at 12.5%. The yields for the five-year and ten-year bonds also fell, decreasing by 9bps and 14bps, respectively, settling at 12.7% and 12.838%. The current account surplus added another layer of confidence, with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reporting a surplus of $349 million for October 2024 — the third consecutive monthly surplus. This improvement is attributed to a 7% month-on-month and 24% year-on-year increase in remittances. Foreign exchange reserves also reached a two-year high, bolstering confidence in the country’s economic recovery. Cumulatively, the current account surplus for the first four months of FY25 stood at $218 million, compared to a deficit of $1.53 billion during the same period last year. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) also demonstrated robust growth, increasing by 32% year-on-year to $904.3 million during the July-October period. October saw a slight dip in FDI compared to the same month last year. Total foreign investment inflows for the period reached $1.242 billion. With reserves projected to cross $11 billion in the coming weeks, local mutual funds have actively shifted investments from fixed-income securities to equities, driving the benchmark index’s 20% surge since September. The PTI protest, led by party leaders and supporters, comes with demands to revoke the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restore democracy, and release detained political workers. Despite a government crackdown, caravans of protesters have moved toward Islamabad, defying court orders and stringent security measures. The timing of the protest coincides with the upcoming visit of the Belarusian president and heightened political tensions across the country. Communications services in major cities, including Karachi and Islamabad, have been disrupted as part of government measures to contain the demonstrations. The KSE-100 Index, which briefly crossed the 99,000-point mark in intra-day trading last week, remains on track to reach historic highs. With favourable economic indicators and robust liquidity, equities continue to present an attractive asset class for investors, maintaining their upward trajectory despite political headwinds.","business"

The summit, due to culminate on Friday, ran into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries — who must adopt the deal by consensus — tried to reach an agreement on the world's climate funding plan for the next decade. The shift in position came after a $250 billion proposal for a deal, drafted by Azerbaijan's COP29 presidency on Friday, was termed by developing countries as insultingly low. It was not immediately clear if the wealthy countries' revised position had been communicated to developing countries at COP29, and whether it would be enough to win their support. Five sources with knowledge of the closed-door discussions said the EU had agreed they could accept the higher number. Two of the sources said the US, Australia and Britain were also on board. A European Commission spokesperson and an Australian government spokesperson both declined to comment on the negotiations. The US delegation at COP29 and the UK energy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A post shared by COP29 Azerbaijan (@cop29_azerbaijan)  Delegates were awaiting a new draft text of the deal on climate finance on Saturday after negotiators worked through the night to bridge wide gaps in their positions. The COP29 talks have laid bare the divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from the soaring costs of storms, floods and droughts fuelled by climate change. The new goal is intended to replace developed countries' previous commitment to provide $100 billion in climate finance for poorer nations per year by 2020. That goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. Any deal would require agreement on more than just the headline amount. Negotiators have been working throughout the two-week summit to address other critical questions on the target, including who is asked to contribute and how much of the funding is on a grant basis, rather than provided as loans. The roster of countries required to contribute — about two dozen industrialised countries, including the US, European nations and Canada — dates back to a list decided during UN climate talks in 1992. European governments have demanded others join them in paying in, including China, the world's second-biggest economy, and oil-rich Gulf states. The recent election of Donald Trump as US President, who has called climate change a hoax, has cast a cloud over the talks in Baku. Negotiators from other wealthy nations expect the world's biggest economy will not pay into the climate finance goal during Trump's impending four-year term. A broader goal of raising $1.3 trillion in climate finance annually by 2035  — which economists say matches the sum needed — was included in the draft deal published on Friday, and would include funding from all public and private sources. Poorer countries have warned that a weak finance deal at COP29 would kneecap their ability to set more ambitious targets to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. Sierra Leone's Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai told Reuters the initial proposal for a $250 billion target for 2035, from Friday, would not amount to a real increase in support when accounting for inflation. ""We've spent three years negotiating these numbers. And with the end of the three years we've got nothing,"" said Abdulai adding that the deal needed stronger language to make accessing funding easier. On Saturday, the least developed country grouping in the UN talks, of which Sierra Leone is a part, will present its red lines for a deal to the COP29 president. A walkout of talks ""should be on the table,"" he told Reuters, adding: ""All options should be on the table"".","business"
"122","Solarisation boom — beneficial for consumers but detrimental for grid","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575866-solarisation-boom-beneficial-for-consumers-but-detrimental-for-grid","Pakistan's power consumption has seen notable changes in recent times with scores of consumers shifting to solar power including the country's agriculture sector featuring rows upon rows of solar panels becoming a new normal. The increase in solarisation trend is reflected in the data compiled byBloombergNEFwhich shows that the import of solar equipment from China in the first nine months of the ongoing year are well ahead of those for the whole of 2023. The $1.7 billion of purchases, as per theBloombergreport, would equate to 17 gigawatts of electricity generation, more than a third of Pakistan's total power capacity if it's all deployed on rooftops and farms across the country. For corn grower, Mohammad Murtaza, installing panels has enabled him to slash his power bill by switching irrigation pumps from diesel or pricey electricity from the grid. Farmers like him are the latest to join the solar craze, following households and factories, in a country where power prices for some have tripled since 2021 as the government cut subsidies to meet International Monetary Fund loan requirements. This breakneck solarisation has several benefits. Including financial relief to consumers and businesses who can afford the panels. Although it's saving the government money on fuel imports and will help Pakistan move towards its goal of doubling renewables to make up 60% of the energy mix by the end of the decade. However, the rapid and unregulated boom also threatens to weaken the country's utilities and destabilise the fragile economy. ""There's a great solar rush happening in Pakistan: the numbers are staggering,"" said Muhammad Mujahid, executive director at Lahore-based panel distributor Innovo Corporation. But it's also creating the ""risk of a utility death spiral,"" he added. As many customers curb their consumption from the grid or even abandon it completely, Pakistan's power companies are permanently losing a major chunk of demand and revenue. State-owned utilities have accumulated losses of Rs2.4 trillion ($8.6 billion) between 2014 and 2023, according to government data. The IMF has said retaining demand should be a key objective of reforms. ""Pakistan's distribution companies are losing every day as solar becomes attractive,"" said Salahuddin Riffai, who was chairman at Islamabad Electric Supply Co until 2022. ""The burden is ever increasing on the customers who are left,"" remarked Riffai. The country was already struggling financially after borrowing heavily from China under the Belt and Road Initiative over the last decade to build up power generation capacity. Pakistan is now in negotiations to try and lengthen the maturities of that debt. The government is also in talks with local power producers to revise or end purchase contracts and is considering privatising some utilities as cost-cutting measures. ""If the government opens up the power market without capping solar capacity, most of the current generation fleet will become idle,"" said Syed Faizan Ali Shah, who sits on the prime minister’' solarisation committee. ""So then who will pay for those power plants? This is a major concern,"" he warned. The flood of solar panels from China started in 2023, and turned into a deluge after Pakistan removed import curbs late last year, making it the third-largest destination for Chinese panels, according to BNEF. Now they're being advertised on billboards in major cities and during cricket matches. The frenzy wasn't restricted to the energy sector as real estate companies and electronics firms also started flipping panels, with the biggest traders bringing in up to 250 megawatts' worth every month, according to Usman Ahmad, chief executive officer at solar distributor Nizam Energy Pvt. Driving the demand were households and factories producing everything from cement to apparel, which have suffered frequent blackouts in the past due to the unreliable grid. Speculation that the grid will collapse is ""extreme"", but the reduction in demand is indeed a concern, said Power Minister Awais Leghari in an interview. Utilities ""have to be a little more sensitive to the demands of customers in terms of reliability and tariffs, he said adding: ""We all realise that the status quo can’t prevail.""","business"
"123","Non-solar consumers bear Rs200bn burden due to net-metering, unregulated solarisation","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575862-non-solar-consumers-bear-rs200bn-burden-due-to-net-metering-unregulated-solarisation","ISLAMABAD: In a worrying revelation, it has come to light that unregulated solarisation in the country has led to non-solar consumers bearing additional burden which exceeded Rs200 billion in fiscal year 2023-24,The Newsreported on Saturday. A report titled ""The Distributed Divide – How Solar Expansion Affects Non-Adopting Consumers and Utility Economics,"" discloses that there was a Rs2 per kilowatt hour tariff increase in FY2023-24 and warns of the fiscal burden to further intensify in the absence of immediate regulatory and policy action. It estimates that a 5% reduction in grid demand due to solar integration will shift an additional Rs131 billion annually to non-solar consumers which essentially doubles to Rs261 billion at a 10% reduction. The incumbent regime has terminated power purchase agreements (PPAs) of five independent power producers (IPPs) that would bring down the power tariff of Rs0.60 per unit and is also in talks with 18 IPPs persuading them to go on take and pay mode to further reduce the electricity rate by Rs0.70-Re1 per unit, but this expected relief in tariff has already been offset with the unregulated surge rooftop solar adoption owing to which non-solar consumers' tariff has increased by Rs2 per unit. The 83-page study, conducted by ARZACHEL, also warns of a potential ""death spiral"" — a dangerous cycle where rising tariffs drive more consumers toward solar — further reducing grid demand and forcing additional tariff hikes on remaining non-solar users. To prevent this, the report stresses a suite of solutions. These include introducing fixed grid access fees to fairly distribute grid service costs, transitioning from net metering to net billing or Feed-in Tariff (FiT) systems with lower rates aligned to marginal system costs, and implementing dynamic pricing models that adjust rates in real-time based on supply-demand fluctuations. It also advocates creating a market for ancillary services to improve grid reliability, incentivising battery energy storage systems (BESS) to address renewable intermittency, and revising the Distribution Code to manage bi-directional power flows. To ensure equity, the report recommends conducting a Distributional Equity Assessment (DEA) to protect non-solar consumers from disproportionate financial impacts while modernising tariffs to reflect fair cost allocation. These targeted reforms are critical to balancing the economic and operational sustainability of Pakistan's energy sector with the benefits of solar energy expansion. According to the findings, solar adoption, driven by rooftop installations and behind-the-meter systems, has reshaped the energy landscape by reducing grid demand by 8-10% during daylight hours. Solar users are avoiding costs of up to Rs20 per unit for net-metering setups and Rs7 per unit for behind-the-meter installations. While this benefits solar adopters, it leaves the fixed costs of grid maintenance and infrastructure upgrades to non-solar consumers. The study proposes a minimum bill of Rs1,000 per KW per month for domestic net-metering users, and Rs2,500 per KW per month for Industrial and commercial consumers using net-metering ensuring that they contribute to the cost of grid maintenance even if they offset most of their consumption through self-generation. This transition has also introduced technical challenges for distribution companies (Discos), including voltage instability, reverse power flows, and growing demand for frequency regulation and reactive power support. These issues, compounded by declining revenues, require significant infrastructure investment. The study says if solar penetration and installation rates continue at their current pace, it is predicted that the Pakistan grid will experience a ""duck curve"" within the next two years. The grid will face significant challenges in maintaining energy stability during the coming winter, especially on clear days, due to insufficient flexible resources to manage the high levels of distributed solar generation. This uneven demand pattern complicates grid management and escalates costs, putting further strain on already stretched resources. Approximately 438.46 gigawatt hours of energy was procured by Discos through net metering in FY 2023-24, displacing 9,942 GWh of grid demand due to both net-metering and behind-the-meter solar generation. The study also mentions that high distributed solar generation poses challenges for the grid, such as voltage instability, reverse power flows, and increased demand for ancillary services like frequency regulation and reactive power support. These changes require infrastructure adjustments and careful demand balancing to maintain grid stability and efficiency.","business"

"125","How Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's alleged bribery scheme took off, unravelled","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575648-how-indian-billionaire-gautam-adanis-alleged-bribery-scheme-took-off-unravelled","NEW YORK: In June of 2020, a renewable energy company owned by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani won what it called the single largest solar development bid ever awarded: an agreement to supply 8 gigawatts of electricity to a state-owned power company. But there was a problem. Local power companies did not want to pay the prices the state company was offering, jeopardising the deal, according to US authorities. To save the deal, Adani allegedly decided to bribe local officials to persuade them to buy the electricity. That allegation is at the heart of US criminal and civil charges unsealed on Wednesday against Adani, who is not currently in US custody and is believed to be in India. His company, Adani Group, said the charges were ""baseless"" and that it would seek ""all possible legal recourse."" The alleged hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes promised to local Indian officials caught the attention of the US Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission as Adani's companies were raising funds from US-based investors in several transactions starting in 2021. This account of how the alleged scheme unfolded is drawn from federal prosecutors' 54-page criminal indictment of Adani and seven of his associates and two parallel civil SEC complaints, which extensively cite electronic messages between the scheme's alleged participants. In early 2020, the Solar Energy Corporation of India awarded Adani Green Energy and another company, Azure Power Global, contracts for a 12-gigawatt solar energy project, expected to yield billions of dollars in revenue for both companies, according to the indictment. It was a major step forward for Adani Green Energy, run by Adani's nephew, Sagar Adani. Up until that point, the company had only earned roughly $50 million in its history and had yet to turn a profit, according to the SEC complaint. But the initiative soon hit roadblocks. Local state electricity distributors were reluctant to commit to buying the new solar power, expecting prices to fall in the future, according to an April 7, 2021 report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank. Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO at the time discussed the delays and hinted at bribes on the encrypted messaging application WhatsApp, according to the SEC. When the Azure CEO wrote on November 24, 2020, that the local power companies ""are being motivated,"" Sagar Adani allegedly replied, ""Yup ... but the optics are very difficult to cover. In February 2021, Sagar Adani allegedly wrote to the CEO, ""Just so you know, we have doubled the incentives to push for these acceptances."" The SEC did not name the Azure CEO as a defendant, but Azure's securities filings show the CEO at the time was Ranjit Gupta. Gupta was charged by the Justice Department with conspiracy to violate an anti-bribery law. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Azure said on Thursday it was cooperating with the US investigations, and that the individuals involved with the accusations had left the company more than a year ago.","business"
"126","Bitcoin approaches $100,000 on optimism over Trump crypto plans","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575660-bitcoin-approaches-100000-on-optimism-over-trump-crypto-plans","Bitcoin came within a whisker of closing above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as United States president spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading between $98,000 and $99,000 in late afternoon trading in the US on Thursday, after briefly touching $99,073. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next US president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump has said he will replace. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Over 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance. ""Everyone who's bought bitcoin at any point in history is currently in profit,"" Alicia Kao, managing director of crypto exchange KuCoin, said. ""But those who bought it early, when there were significant obstacles to doing so and there was the might of the world's financial and governmental forces intent on crushing it, are the real winners. Not because they're rich, but because they're right.” Bitcoin's rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price on Thursday. “Once you break out to new highs, you attract a lot of new capital,"" John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said. ""It's like gold in the 1970s, where this new high is in a price discovery mode. You don't know how high it's going to go,"" he said. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticised for its energy usage, with miners under scrutiny over their potential impact on power grids and greenhouse gas emissions due to their energy-intensive operations. Crypto crime also remains a concern, with an analysis by crypto researchers Chainalysis finding that at least $24.2 billion worth of crypto was sent to illicit wallet addresses last year, including addresses identified as sanctioned or linked to terrorist financing and scams.","business"
"127","Massive profit-taking caps gains after stocks leap past 99,600 mark","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575657-psx-continues-record-breaking-rally-on-positive-macros","   Stocks on Friday closed with modest gains after a dramatic leap during the day trade, surging past the 99,600 mark, as politics-wary investors cashed in massive profits in the latter half by shedding overbought stocks like there's no tomorrow. The Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Shares Index could secure only 469.84 points or 0.48% after an ongoing economic optimism-driven rally tossed the stocks to a day high of 99,623.03 points. Tahir Abbas, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited, toldGeo.tvthat the market is in continuous positive momentum. The primary reasons behind this, he said, are the economic indicators, improvement of macros, plus the expectation that the inflation number will be around 4.5% this month. Then, Abbas added, there was an expectation that interest rates would be cut further next month. The analyst also noted the key role of liquidity in driving the market’s growth, saying: ""Apart from that, local liquidity is very robust. Money is coming into the market continuously from different sets of investors."" Increased liquidity from mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies has further fueled the rally, with market experts pointing to surging foreign exchange reserves, positive current account data, and privatisation hopes as catalysts for growth. Across-the-board buying was observed in key sectors including automobile assemblers, commercial banks, fertiliser, oil and gas exploration companies, and power generation. Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), increased by $29 million to $11.29 billion, marking a 31-month high. Total liquid foreign reserves reached $15.97 billion. The Pakistani rupee appreciated 0.11% on Friday, closing at Rs277.96 a dollar in the inter-bank market. Arif Habib Limited in its market wrap said the PSX achieved another milestone as market activity surged to a 7.5-year high, with a traded value of Rs45.5 billion ($164 million). ""This marks the highest activity in the regular market since 31-May-17 (MSCI reclassification day),"" the brokerage said, adding that excluding that day, it was the highest traded value recorded since April 11, 2008 — nearly 17 years ago. Market sentiment is buoyed by inflation dropping to levels unseen since 2022. Expectations of an interest rate cut next month are drawing investors from fixed-income securities to equities, contributing to the PSX’s robust growth. Despite the consistent upward trajectory, analysts maintain that PSX valuations remain attractive, signaling further room for growth. Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, noted that the market’s recent decline from 2017-23 was largely due to political uncertainty. However, he added: “With inflation and interest rates declining and Pakistan’s IMF relationship stabilising, economic recovery is strengthening investor confidence. If political protests remain peaceful, the index could cross 100,000 points soon and potentially exceed 127,000 by 2025.” The political backdrop has been tense, with the main opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf planning a major protest in Islamabad on November 24. The protest, labelled as a “do-or-die” demonstration, has heightened political uncertainty, further fueled by the government’s strong warnings of strict action against any unrest. Meanwhile, security concerns and increased militant activity in the northwestern regions have added to the unease, creating a challenging environment for investors. In the previous session, the PSX’s benchmark KSE-100 index surged by 1,781.94 points, or 1.86%, to close at an all-time high of 97,328.39 points.","business"

Bitcoin prices topped $96,000 for the first time in Asia trade, touching a high just above $96,898. The cryptocurrency's price has more than doubled this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next US president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress.

The Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Shares Index surged by 1781.94 points, or 1.86%, to close at an all-time high of 97,328.39 after touching an intraday high of 97,437.15 points. Ahsan Mehanti, Managing Director and CEO of Arif Habib Commodities, also highlighted the factors driving today’s record surge, saying, “Stocks bullish led by scrips across the board as investors weigh drop in government bond yields and robust economic data for current account surplus, remittances, exports, and foreign direct investment.” “Surging foreign exchange reserves and speculations over government decisions on economic reforms and privatisation played a catalyst role in the record surge at PSX,” he added. The government raised Rs350 billion through the auction of Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), exceeding the target of Rs300 billion, with yields on five-year and 10-year papers falling to their lowest levels since March 2022. “The central bank received bids amounting to Rs893 billion, against a target of Rs300 billion, resulting in a bid-cover ratio of 3.0x,” said Arif Habib Limited in a note. The cut-off yield for the two-year zero-coupon bond decreased by 19 basis points (bps) to 13.0%. Meanwhile, the cut-off yield for the three-year bond remained unchanged at 12.5%. The yields for the five-year and ten-year bonds also fell, decreasing by 9bps and 14bps, respectively, settling at 12.7% and 12.838%. The current account surplus added another layer of confidence, with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reporting a surplus of $349 million for October 2024 — the third consecutive monthly surplus. This improvement is attributed to a 7% month-on-month and 24% year-on-year increase in remittances. Foreign exchange reserves also reached a two-year high, bolstering confidence in the country’s economic recovery. Cumulatively, the current account surplus for the first four months of FY25 stood at $218 million, compared to a deficit of $1.53 billion during the same period last year. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) also demonstrated robust growth, increasing by 32% year-on-year to $904.3 million during the July-October period. October saw a slight dip in FDI compared to the same month last year. Total foreign investment inflows for the period reached $1.242 billion. With reserves projected to cross $11 billion in the coming weeks, local mutual funds have actively shifted investments from fixed-income securities to equities, driving the benchmark index’s 20% surge since September. Commenting on the market’s recovery, Muhammad Saad Ali, Director Research at Intermarket Securities Ltd, stated, “Yesterday was a healthy correction. The market has resumed its momentum, and the range of stocks which are rallying is broadening to include more small and mid-caps.” Buying was witnessed in multiple sectors including automobile assemblers, commercial banks, fertilisers, pharmaceuticals and refineries. The rebound follows a volatile midweek session that ended with a 310-point decline amid profit-taking and political uncertainty. The political backdrop has been tense, with the main opposition party planning a major protest in Islamabad on November 24, demanding electoral reforms and the release of its detained leaders and workers. The protest, labelled as a “do-or-die” demonstration, has heightened political uncertainty, further fueled by the government’s strong warnings of strict action against any unrest.

"131","Awaiting Trump, US auto execs further temper EV push","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575432-awaiting-trump-us-auto-execs-further-temper-ev-push","NEW YORK: US auto giants signaled Wednesday they could further slow the ramp-up of electric vehicle production as Detroit awaits the arrival of a Trump administration eager to reverse key Biden climate initiatives. Donald Trump's transition officials have discussed killing a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, according to US media. The EV tax credit was included in President Joe Biden's flagship climate change law, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, spoke during the campaign dismissively of Biden administration fuel economy standards as a ""mandate"" that he argued would doom internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. US auto executives said Wednesday they are preparing for potentially significant policy changes from Washington. ""We're modeling various scenarios and we will adjust accordingly,"" Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said at a Wall Street conference. Lawler said Ford's embrace of hybrid vehicles provided greater flexibility depending on how the new rules evolve. He described the potential removal of the tax credit as exacerbating an oversupply of costly electric models. ""One of the things we believe is that there is going to be incredible pressure on prices next year in the EV market,"" Lawler said. ""The one thing we do know... is that consumers are not willing to pay much of a premium for EVs versus an ICE vehicle."" General Motors Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said it is ""too soon"" to speculate on what policies Trump will pursue, but that the company is committed to its EV strategy as a ""long-term objective."" GM is focused on reducing costs throughout EV development and on having flexible operations, such as a plant in Tennessee that can produce both combustion and electric vehicles, he said. The storied automaker could ""temper"" future EV investment steps depending on how the market evolves, Jacobson said. Both Ford and GM have slowed or reversed some EV projects in recent years amid uneven demand growth. Trump transition officials targeting the tax credit include oil executive Harold Hamm, according to articles in the New York Times and other publications. Trump softened his own EV criticism somewhat during the campaign as he worked closely with mega supporter Elon Musk, the chief executive of EV maker Tesla. Musk has said that eliminating the tax credit could harm competitors seeking to challenge Tesla's leadership in the segment.","business"
"132","ECC greenlights winter package for electricity consumers","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575296-ecc-greenlights-winter-package-for-electricity-consumers","ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the federal cabinet has approved the winter package for electricity on incremental usage from domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers,The Newsreported on Wednesday. The incumbent government's winter package is aimed at incentivising the utilisation of electricity from the national grid to collect money from consumers for paying off capacity charges that run into around Rs2.7 trillion for the current fiscal year. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's administration, earlier this month, announced introducing the ""Bijli Sahulat Package"" for three months — December 2024 to February 2025. The package will allow industries, commercial, general services and households to save significantly as compared to the prevailing tariffs. The use of power drops significantly during the winter season, ranging from around 9,000 to 12,000 megawatts while in summer it peaks to the highest level of over 32,000 MW. Such a gap requires some incentives in the winter season to boost up consumption of electricity. In the aftermath of solarisation, there was a need to make incremental usage of electricity in the winter season. During its meeting today under the chairmanship of Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, the ECC considered a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) regarding a winter demand initiative for the industrial, domestic ToU (Time of Use) and non-ToU consumers exceeding 200 units, commercial and general services consumers of Discos and K-Electric to enable optimum use of system generation capacity besides reducing gas demand due to shifting of favourable demand towards electricity. It was proposed that under the initiative, a tariff of Rs26.07 per kilowatt hour shall be charged to all eligible consumers on the respective incremental consumption, above the benchmark consumption in the corresponding months. The initiative would be applicable for a three-month billing period effective from December 2024 to February 2025. The benchmark consumption would be the higher of either the relevant month’s consumption in FY2024 or the historical consumption over the past three years for the relevant months, based on a formula and terms and conditions laid before the ECC. The ECC discussed the proposal and approved it, calling the subsidy-neutral interim relief initiative worked out by the Power Division as being timely and relevant in view of the recent surge in electricity tariffs and reduced demand across various consumer categories. Furthermore, the forum also considered a proposal submitted by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) for the transfer of Rs3.140 billion balance of erstwhile Emergency Relief Cell (ERC) into the NDMA Fund to carry out its inland as well as overseas rescue and relief operations in line with the statutory mandate of the authority. The suggestion was approved with the proviso that since the balances in the ERC were made up of public donations and were granted for relief, rescue and rehabilitation of floods and earthquake victims, the NDMA would spend these balances for the stated purpose.","business"

The Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Shares Index  retreated to 95,546.45 points, down 310.21 points or 0.32%, from the previous close of 95,856.66, after hitting a day high of 96,711.33 points. While the rally reflects broad-based optimism, market correction emerged midday. Ahsan Mehanti, Managing Director and CEO of Arif Habib Commodities, attributed the bearish trend to the prevailing political and economic instability, stating: “Stocks bearish on political uncertainty and security unrest in the country. Rupee instability, foreign outflows, and pending IMF board decision over government's alternate levies to minibudget triggered the bearish activity.” The market sentiment may have been dampened by heightened political noise, including the planned protest on November 24 by an opposition party, and escalated security concerns due to militancy. Samiullah Tariq, Head of Research and Development at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company (Private) Limited, commented, “The market is taking correction today as it has gained significantly during the year.” The market’s momentum is being sustained by strong performances in key sectors such as technology, banking, and energy, alongside policy clarity and optimism regarding economic recovery. Sectors, including cement, banking, fertiliser, oil and gas exploration, oil marketing, and power generation remained in the limelight. Notable gains were posted by index-heavy names such as K-Electric, Pakistan State Oil, Shell, Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Mari Petroleum, Meezan Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, and Habib Bank. Factors supporting the rally are falling inflation, a 32% year-on-year surge in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to $904 million during July-October, and a current account surplus of $349 million for October 2024. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that October marked the third consecutive monthly current account surplus, driven by a 7% month-on-month and 24% year-on-year rise in remittances. Foreign exchange reserves have also reached a two-year high, with projections exceeding $11 billion in the coming weeks. Inflation trends further bolstered investor sentiment. November’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) is projected to fall between 4.5% and 5%, marking a historic decline—the first time in 78 months inflation is anticipated to drop below 5%. For FY25, inflation is expected to average around 7.5%. The technology sector led the rally, supported by a significant rise in export remittances from the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. Remittances surged 34.9% year-on-year to $1.206 billion during July-October 2024, with October alone witnessing a 38.6% increase to $330 million.

Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Dr Kazim Niaz and ADB Country Director, Ms Emma Fan signed the loan agreement. The ceremony was attended by senior officials from the government and the multilateral lender. Cheema, while consenting to the agreement, said that signing the agreement underscores Pakistan’s commitment to prioritise climate change initiatives and scaling up disaster risk financing using a risk-layered approach. ""This programme is designed as a programmatic approach and aims to strengthen Pakistan's capacity for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management, addressing the country’s vulnerabilities to natural disasters and climate impacts,"" both officials said in a joint statement after signing the agreement. Last week, Pakistan launched its first National Climate Finance Strategy (NCFS) to tackle the growing challenges of global warming with a strategy of mobilising funds for climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. The strategy focuses on increasing climate-related investments, attracting international financing, and enhancing domestic financial systems. Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Prime Minister’s Coordinator on Climate Change Romina Khurshid Alam jointly launched NCFS at the Pakistan Pavilion in Baku on the sidelines of the two-week UN-led global climate conference (COP29) on November 15. “It is a moment of pride for us to be able to roll out Pakistan’s first-ever climate finance strategy, a major step in our commitment to a sustainable and climate-resilient future,” PM’s climate aide Romina Khurshid Alam said in her keynote remarks at the launching event. Explaining the strategy, she said that the climate finance strategy outlines a path to bridge the significant climate finance gap facing Pakistan—a gap we estimate at $348 billion by 2030 for our climate-resilient and low-carbon development goals.

Biden announced the three-year US pledge during a closed session of the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, the official told reporters, adding that the US. Treasury was leading negotiations at the World Bank for the IDA replenishment. The new US pledge is a record and substantially exceeds the $3.5 billion Washington committed in the previous IDA fund replenishment round in December 2021. It is unclear if US President-elect Donald Trump, who has proposed cutting foreign aid in the past, will honor Biden's pledge as he and billionaire Tesl and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk seek to slash US spending through a new government efficiency panel. An appropriation by the US Congress to fund the commitment would not likely take place until after Trump takes office in January. A spokesperson for Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. Earlier in Rio de Janeiro, US deputy national security adviser Jonathan Finer told reporters that Biden would announce a ""historic"" pledge to the IDA replenishment. Finer also told reporters at a briefing on the G20 summit that Biden will launch a bilateral clean energy partnership when he meets Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Tuesday. The World Bank's IDA fund, which provides mainly grants and very low interest loans to the poorest countries, is replenished every three years, and a pledging conference is scheduled for December 5 - 6 in Seoul. World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming for a record amount exceeding the $93 billion refunding in December 2021, amid rising demands from poor nations in Africa and elsewhere that are struggling with crushing debts, climate disasters, conflict and other pressures. Banga toldReutersin October that a $120 billion replenishment is possible, but that goal would require some substantial increases in country commitments. Biden's new US commitment is about 14.3% higher than its 2021 contribution. At the IMF-World Bank annual meetings in October, Spain announced plans to boost its contribution by 37% to 400 million euros ($423 million).

"137","IMF points out defects in budget formulation, execution","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575118-imf-points-out-defects-in-budget-formulation-execution","ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has pointed out glaring defects in the budget-making and execution practices in Pakistan underscoring significant changes to the size and composition of spending compared to the approved annual budget by the parliament,The Newsreported on Tuesday. IMF's ""Pakistan's Technical Assistance Report: Budget Practicing"" says that an examination of the country's recent budgetary outcomes has revealed substantial deviations from planned budgets. While these discrepancies are partially due to an unstable external environment and political uncertainties, the establishment of stronger fiscal institutions can help deliver a more credible budget, tighten its execution, and prevent policy slippages. The deviation, as per the Fund, reached almost 55% in the approved budget in fiscal year 2022-23 compared to the actual spending through technical supplementary grants and supplementary grants. The report, while noting changes to the size and composition of spending compared to the approved annual budget, says that these in-year changes have occurred either through technical supplementary grants and supplementary and excess grants — henceforth supplementary grants — which are additional grants approved during the year not met by the surrender of existing grants — as defined by Article 84 of the Constitution. In FY23, the sum of these supplementary grants exceeded 50% of budget spending. The data quoted by the IMF shows that there were changes of Rs1,910 billion, equivalent to 21.9% of the approved budget in fiscal year 2022-23 and such deviation on development and current budget peaked at 54.7% than the approved budget by the National Assembly. Given the extraordinary latitude taken by the executive in its interpretation of Article 84 of the Constitution to approve these grants without the prior approval of the NA, this means that a significant proportion of spending does not undergo the prior scrutiny of the latter. Islamabad faces a tight fiscal situation which will require strong control over the budget in the coming years. The public debt has increased considerably, and interest payments now absorb 60% of budgeted revenue. Multiple external shocks and unprecedented floods in 2022 have buffeted the economy and the government’s fiscal position. These shocks have been compounded by policy slippages including un-budgeted subsidies, and delays in implementing revenue measures. Authorities now have the difficult task of converting a primary deficit of 1.3 % of GDP for FY23 into a primary surplus for FY24 and continuing to exercise fiscal restraint, while preserving essential social and development spending. In this context, it will be crucial to further enhance the country's Public Financial Management (PFM) system as well as strengthen revenue mobilisation and administration. Furthermore, the IMF report focuses on how to strengthen budget preparation, execution, and controls, including ways to harness digital technologies for that purpose. There are other important areas in PFM where the authorities are making progress, such as the oversight of state enterprises, cash and debt management, the Treasury Single Account (TSA), and public investment management, which have been the focus of previous IMF technical reports. Identifying how this can be done in Pakistan, its main findings are Macro-Fiscal Forecasting which is distributed among different institutions which are responsible for forecasting macroeconomic indicators, tax revenue, public debt service, and development spending — largely comprising capital projects — but are poorly coordinated. A macro-fiscal policy unit (MFPU) has been put in place in the Economic Adviser’s Wing but is at an early stage of development and does not yet provide effective support for the Finance Division, particularly its Budget Wing. A National Macro-Fiscal Framework is prepared but does not kick-start the budget preparation process. A top-down, strategic phase at the start of budget preparation could be strengthened, with spending ministries and agencies required to prepare their budget submissions under relatively weak constraints and insufficient guidance on the available fiscal space. Several other budgeting practices could be strengthened: (i) there is an inefficient dual budgeting system with a bloated pipeline of projects in the Public Sector Development Plan (PSDP) and separate decision-making processes for recurrent and development spending; (ii) the budget call circular (BCC) provides spending ministries and divisions with little guidance on budget priorities and spending ceilings are out of date; and (iii) the organisation of the Finance Division is fragmented and not well-tuned to provide an effective policy advice on the budget, and effective scrutiny of budget proposals. The executive is a relative outlier internationally in terms of its ability to award in-year supplementary grants without ex-ante approval from the NA and without any limit on their size. Extensive use of these grants has been made in recent years. They amounted to 14% of approved spending in the last two years. In addition, technical supplementary grants, or re-allocations across budget appropriations, amounted to another 13% of approved spending in the last two years. While legislative approval may occasionally hinder prompt responses to emergencies, a balanced solution should be adopted in Pakistan, as is the case elsewhere. The example of the previous caretaker government, which oversees the budget without resorting to supplementary grants, shows that strong commitment can lead to effective budget management without total flexibility. Another challenge in budget execution is the absence of comprehensive commitment control mechanisms, which, at a minimum, affects proper budget monitoring, but can, more worryingly, lead to over-commitment of spending, unwanted supplementary grants, and arrears.","business"
"138","PSX hits new dizzying heights, tests 96,000 resistance level on strong macros","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575104-kse-100-index-surges-to-95600","  Capital market continued its record-breaking streak on Tuesday, reaching an all-time high after briefly breaching 96,000 points psychological barrier, with investors buoyed by encouraging macroeconomic developments and policy clarity from the finance minister. This marks a continuation of Monday’s rally, as the Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) KSE-100 Shares Index soared by 860.99 points or 0.91% to hit an intraday high of 95,856.66. During intraday trading, euphoric investors pushed the apex index to 96,036.48 points, but late profit-taking prevented the market from sustaining that level. The session began at the previous close of 94,995.67, maintaining positive momentum fuelled by strong performances in key sectors, including telecommunication, banking, and energy. Stocks like Hascol Petroleum, Waves Home Appliances, and TPL Properties are among the most actively traded, with significant gains reflecting retail and institutional participation. Investor sentiment was lifted by Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb’s assurance that the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent visit posed no threat to Pakistan’s $7 billion loan programme. He confirmed that there were no discussions of additional taxes, particularly for the salaried class or manufacturing sector. Muhammad Saad Ali, Director Research at Intermarket Securities Ltd, commented, “Conclusion of IMF mission visit – without the IMF demanding new tax measures or mini-budget – is major positive in helping the market to continue the rally.” ""Liquidity in the market is very strong with institutional investors being net buyers given interest rates have come off sharply and are likely to fall further."" ""Market so far not much worried about the PTI protest later in November,” he added. Adding to the optimism, the government announced a landmark decision allowing Exploration and Production (E&P) firms to sell 35% of future gas discoveries to the private sector, a move aimed at mitigating circular debt in the energy sector. The Implementation Framework for the amended E&P Policy 2012 will soon be presented for final approval, providing clarity and opportunities for private-sector involvement. The technology sector also contributed to the positive market outlook, with remittances from information and communication technology (ICT) exports rising 34.9% year-on-year to $1.206 billion during July-October 2024. In October alone, export remittances reached $330 million, marking a 38.6% increase compared to the same month last year. Sana Tawfik, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited, highlighted the critical role of improving macroeconomic indicators, such as inflation, in sustaining the bullish market. “Key indicators, such as inflation, are showing positive trends. Inflation is projected to average around 7.5% for FY25,"" she said. ""For November 2024, it is expected to fall within the range of 4.5% to 5%. This represents a significant decline,"" she noted. The current account surplus added another layer of confidence, with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reporting a surplus of $349 million for October 2024—the third consecutive monthly surplus. This improvement is attributed to a 7% month-on-month and 24% year-on-year increase in remittances. Foreign exchange reserves also reached a two-year high, bolstering confidence in the country’s economic recovery. Cumulatively, the current account surplus for the first four months of FY25 stood at $218 million, compared to a deficit of $1.53 billion during the same period last year. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) also demonstrated robust growth, increasing by 32% year-on-year to $904.3 million during the July-October period. October saw a slight dip in FDI compared to the same month last year. Total foreign investment inflows for the period reached $1.242 billion. With reserves projected to cross $11 billion in the coming weeks, local mutual funds have actively shifted investments from fixed-income securities to equities, driving the benchmark index’s 20% surge since September. Ahsan Mehanti, Managing Director and CEO of Arif Habib Commodities, highlighted the positive macroeconomic factors, saying, “Stocks are bullish on reports of current account surplus."" ""Investors weighed surging foreign exchange reserves and government decisions over economic reforms for state-owned enterprises (SOE), independent power producers (IPPs), and energy pricing."" ""Next triggers could be easing political noise amid protest calls by the opposition,” he added Telecommunication and financial stocks led the rally on Monday, with PTCL (38.82 million shares traded) and Sui Southern Gas Company (48.77 million shares) among the standout performers. Analysts attributed the ongoing rally to structural reforms, robust corporate earnings, and the absence of a mini-budget. The IMF’s acknowledgement of Pakistan’s progress in improving its tax-to-GDP ratio, coupled with the government’s focus on state-owned enterprise reforms and IPP deals, has instilled confidence among investors.","business"

Chairing a meeting in Islamabad to review overall economic situation of the country, the prime minster said that those dodging taxes would be brought to justice. He directed the relevant authorities to expedite action against tax evaders, saying: “National progress is possible only when everyone fulfils their due responsibility.” Highlighting his government's major economic achievements, the premier mentioned the bullish trend in stock market and reduced inflation rate from 38% to 7%. Pakistan’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation dropped to 6.9% year-on-year in September 2024, the lowest since January 2021, down from 9.6% in August, driven by the high base effect, easing commodity and energy markets, and a stable currency, according to statistics issued by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) last month. ""Relief for the people is being prioritised over every other step to fulfill the promises made to them,"" said the premier. He said the decline in interest rate from 22% to 15% will boost business activities in the country. The PM said: “Confidence of foreign investors has increased during the last few months of incumbent government while foreign exchange reserves have also witnessed a surge due to the increase in domestic exports and record remittances.” In addition to this, the PM paid tribute to the Punjab government for landmark reforms in the agricultural sector. Last week, taking the lead among provinces, the Punjab Assembly approved the Punjab Agricultural Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024, despite a walkout by PPP and PTI lawmakers protesting the rejection of their proposed amendments. The meeting was briefed about the current situation of the economy, inflation and actions taken against tax evaders. A day earlier, Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb said all the promises made with the IMF were transparent and there was nothing secret which came under discussion with the Fund’s team that visited Pakistan last week, according toThe Newsreport. “All the promises made with the IMF on account of quantitative and qualitative targets are transparent and placed on the Fund’s website. This is Pakistan’s program which is held, supported, assisted and funded by the IMF,” he said in a televised address. “There is no surprise in it and I welcome this visit of the IMF because of the ongoing dialogue, as mutual trust develops through dialogue.” The National Fiscal Pact, he said, was a structural benchmark which got implemented by the end of September 2024. He said the government had shared the right-sizing of the government plan with the IMF and its objective was to improve the public finance. Aurangzeb said the Agriculture Income Tax (AIT) was pursued and he was thankful to all the four chief ministers for moving this agenda forward. On taxation, the finance minister said he was firm that they would go for compliance and enforcement, adding that the salaried class and manufacturing sector could not be taxed more for revenue generation. “All other sectors will have to play their role; we all have to contribute including real estate, wholesalers and agri income tax. It is not a request, but we will have to do it because as a country our hands have been forced. I have made it clear and I want complete clarity on this issue,” he emphasised.  — Additional input from Radio Pakistan.","business"

The minister made these remarks while addressing a press conference following the conclusion of a visit by IMF's mission — led by Nathan Porter from November 12 to 15. ""They [IMF] didn't say anything that we were not aware of already [...] there were no surprises,"" Aurangzeb said, adding that he welcomed the Fund mission’s visit.   Since the visit was not anticipated, there were reports that the global lender's visit would mean that the federal government would have to roll out a mini-budget. However, Aurangzeb — while talking toGeo Newsearlier — dismissed the possibility and also denied reports of additional tax measures. In a statement issued a day earlier, the global lender said it has urged Pakistan to broaden its tax base by targeting untapped revenue sources — as the country grapples with challenges in expanding its tax collection. The Fund said the staff visits are standard practice for countries with semi-annual programme reviews and aim to engage with the authorities and other stakeholders on the country's economic developments and policies and the status of planned reforms. Addressing the presser, the finance minister said that the Fund and Pakistan were engaged in a continuous dialogue as ""mutual credibility and trust"" is built through bilateral talks. The minister pointed out that reforms related to taxation, energy reforms and state-owned enterprise (SOE), privatisation and public finance were on the IMF's visit agenda. He further said that the visiting mission took stock of the situation and held discussions on various matters, including climate resilience. ""We shared our economic road map with visiting IMF mission and how we will take it [reforms] forward,"" he said, adding that the interactions would continue virtually. At the same time, he said he would also welcome another opportunity to meet IMF officials ""face-to-face"". At the outset of the presser, the finance minister said he wanted to share the developments, that came about in the past four weeks starting from the Pakistani delegation's visit to Washington for IMF-World Bank meetings. The delegation — which included the Finance Secretary, Economic Affairs Division Secretary, and SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] Governor — held extensive discussions with various stakeholders, including officials from the IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Bank and International Finance Corporation, and rating agencies. ""I have been very clear right from the beginning, that we will engage with rating agencies at the highest level in the government because we need to know where we are and where we are heading,” he said. Following ""positive meetings"" with Moody’s and Fitch, Aurangzeb said, they succeeded in achieving upgrades in ratings in the first quarter of this fiscal year. Similarly, Aurangzeb said he engaged with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, Turkiye, the United Kingdom, and the US Treasury. The minister said the government's prudent economic policies have resulted in a reduction of inflation from 38% to just 7% and the policy rate from 22% to 15%, while foreign exchange reserves have surged from two weeks of import cover to 2.5 months of import cover. The finance czar said the international community, financial institutions, and rating agencies have commended the government's efforts in leading the country's economy from deficits to surpluses. He further said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would also share a home-grown agenda with the nation soon on how we will take forward our economic stability. “It [the agenda] has been very well syndicated with all the stakeholders,” he added. Concluding the presser, Aurangzeb called on all the political parties, media, and other stakeholders to join hands for charters on the environment and economy to ensure a safe and healthy future for the coming generations.","business"
"142","ADB launches initiative to promote food security amid climate change","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574779-climate-change-adb-launches-initiative-to-promote-food-security","ISLAMABAD: As countries around the world continue to face worsening effects of climate change, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Sunday launched a new regional programme ""Glaciers to Farms"" to promote sustainable water use and food security in Central Asia, the South Caucasus and Pakistan. The initiative will see the ADB, supported by the Green Climate Fund's (GCF) Project Preparation Facility, carry out risk assessments of glacial melt in Azerbaijan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan — forming the scientific and technical basis for the programme, read the press release issued by the lender. With temperatures in the region projected to rise by up to 6°C by the next century, the loss of glacial mass threatens the fragile balance of ecosystems, jeopardising water supply for agriculture and hydro-power and risking the livelihoods of more than 380 million people. A declaration of support for preserving glaciers has been signed with ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa and GCF Chief Investment Officer Henry Gonzalez. The signatories include COP29 President and Azerbaijan Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources Mukhtar Babayev; Kazakhstan Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources Yerlan Nyssanbayev; Kyrgyz Republic Minister of Natural Resources, Ecology and Technical Supervision Meder Mashiev; Tajikistan Committee on Environmental Protection Chairman Bahodur Sheralizoda; and Uzbekistan Minister of Ecology, Environmental Protection, and Climate Change Aziz Abdukhakimov. ""As melting glaciers change waterflows, disrupt lives, and destroy ecosystems, we must act now,"" said Asakawa. ""As Asia and the Pacific’s climate bank, we are pleased to be joined by key partners to launch this programme to drive international collaboration and deliver results where they matter most — on the ground, in communities at risk,"" he added. Glaciers to Farms envisages mobilising up to $3.5 billion from ADB, GCF, governments, development partners, and the private sector, subject to the participating institutions’ board approvals. In addition to water and agriculture investments, the programme will support vulnerable communities threatened by glacial melt, particularly in fragile mountain regions. ""The GCF recognises the regional Glaciers to Farms programme as a vital initiative to enhance climate resilience and promote sustainable development,"" said Gonzalez. ""Recognising the profound vulnerability of mountain communities and ecosystems, this programme is instrumental in safeguarding our precious water resources and empowering those most at risk. ""This programme embodies the essential collaboration and innovative strategies needed to address the severe challenges posed by climate change. Together, we can build a resilient and sustainable future for all — especially for the vulnerable populations who depend on our mountain landscapes,"" he added. The event was also attended by Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb and Georgia Minister for Economy and Sustainable Development Genadi Arveladze. Glaciers are essential natural service providers, it said adding they store freshwater that melts gradually, feeding rivers that support demand for agriculture, hydropower, and drinking water across national borders. In upstream areas, shrinking glaciers diminish water flow, impacting local agriculture and increasing water shortages. Downstream, increased glacial runoff can cause floods. As glaciers continue to shrink, both upstream and downstream communities face greater water and food insecurity and more risk to critical infrastructure. Glaciers to Farms is one of several ADB initiatives to help Asia adapt to melting glaciers. In the Hindu Kush Himalaya, ADB is establishing early warning systems and climate-resilient infrastructure. In monsoonal South and Southeast Asia, the bank is enhancing resilience throughout entire river basins. The United Nations General Assembly has declared 2025 the International Year of Glacier Preservation, while Tajikistan will host the International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation in Dushanbe next year.","business"

The development comes after the IMF's mission — led by Nathan Porter — concluded a staff visit to Pakistan from November 12 to 15. ""The discussions with the IMF were constructive and productive. Virtual negotiations with the IMF, however, are ongoing, as certain points required in-person discussions,” Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb toldGeo Newson Saturday.   He emphasised that open and fact-based dialogue was held with the IMF team. According to the finance minister, the global lender's delegation listened carefully to Pakistan’s position and appeared satisfied with the discussions. ""The purpose of the IMF's visit was not to review the economy but to build confidence,"" stressed Aurangzeb, who is a first-time finance minister, with a long working experience in the private banking sector. In a statement earlier today, the global lender said it has urged Pakistan to broaden its tax base by targeting untapped revenue sources —  as the country grapples with challenges in expanding its tax collection. The Fund said the staff visits are standard practice for countries with semi-annual programme reviews and aim to engage with the authorities and other stakeholders on the country's economic developments and policies and the status of planned reforms. ""We had constructive discussions with the authorities on their economic policy and reform efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and lay the basis for stronger and sustainable growth,"" Porter said in a statement. The official added that the visiting delegation and the Pakistani authorities agreed on the need to continue prudent fiscal and monetary policies and revenue mobilisation from untapped tax bases while transferring greater social and development responsibilities to provinces. In addition, he said, structural energy reforms and constructive efforts are critical to restore the sector's viability. The IMF, meanwhile, said it was encouraged by the Pakistani authorities' reaffirmed commitment to the economic reforms supported by the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Moreover, the finance minister termed the failed Pakistan International Airline's (PIA) privatisation move a ""setback"" for the government but stressed that the IMF listened to the government on this and privatisation of state-owned enterprises would continue. ""We will continue with it and not only PIA but all state owned enterprises like Gencos, DISCOs and airports will be privatised gradually,"" FinMin Aurangzeb clarified.

The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP), chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, rejected a Rs10 billion bid from Blue World City on Thursday, following a recommendation by the Privatisation Commission Board. The development comes after the bid for a 60% stake in PIA fell far short of the minimum price of Rs85.03 billion, leading the government to consider alternative strategies to divest the airline. Following the setback, Federal Minister for Privatisation Abdul Aleem Khan reiterated the government's resolve to privatise the airline saying that the process will be carried out in a ""better way"". Meanwhile, sources say that the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments have also expressed interest in acquiring the PIA — although the former has denied such reports. The KP government, on November 1, formally declared its readiness to submit a competitive bid for PIA. In a follow-up letter addressed to Aleem, KP Board of Investment and Trade (KP-BOIT) Vice Chairman Hassan Masood Kunwar emphasised the strategic importance of the acquisition and requested an update on the status of the proposal. Furthermore, the official told the publication that the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led administration was evaluating direct G2G arrangements with countries like Qatar, other Gulf nations and China as these countries have historically provided financial support to Pakistan and could play a pivotal role in the airline’s privatisation. PIA has not turned a profit in nearly two decades and is burdened with Rs200 billion in liabilities. The government is considering making the airline debt-free to attract buyers, having already shifted about three-quarters of its $3 billion debt to government accounts during the previous privatisation attempt said the official. ""This marks another setback in the efforts to privatise PIA,"" an official remarked, adding: ""We need to revise the terms and explore other avenues to make the airline more appealing to investors"". Furthermore, the CCoP also formed a committee, co-chaired by the minister of state for finance, to evaluate options for privatising the Roosevelt Hotel in New York which is owned by PIA. Additionally, the CCoP directed authorities to finalise the sale of Services International Hotel before its next meeting. The meeting included key ministers from privatisation, commerce, industry, finance and power, along with federal secretaries from various divisions.","business"

Dr Khaqan Najeeb, former Advisor to the Ministry of Finance, while commenting on the development, said that the IMF's visit was an  engagement for stock-taking of the first quarter's quantitative results and ongoing structural benchmarks for reforms. ""The preliminary findings  highlight the work needed on the perennial issues of broadening the tax base in 3 areas (agri income tax, retail and real estate) plagued with substantive tax gaps, and the need for devolution of finances to the provinces as envisaged in line with the 18th amendment,"" he said. Dr Khaqan stressed that the energy sector’s restructuring beyond pricing changes remains critical, coupled with a reduced footprint of the state,  something which the country has found hard to do. ""The need for a competitive energy sector market has been an ongoing effort for years  and has been emphasised by IMF yet again. ""The IMF engagement also highlights the importance of Pakistans' fiscal consolidation and external buffers for sustaining macro stability,"" Khaqan said. The engagement may help ensure Pakistan authorities stay on course for meeting targets of first review in 1st quarter of 2025, he added.","business"

The prices of petrol and HSD will remain at Rs248.38 and Rs255.14 per litre, respectively. In the last fortnight, the government increased the price of petrol and diesel by Rs1.35 and HSD by Rs3.85 per litre, respectively. However, the prices of other petroleum products were reduced. The price of kerosene oil was reduced to Rs161.54, down by Rs1.48 from Rs163.02 per litre. Likewise, the price of light-diesel oil was also reduced by Rs2.61 from Rs150.12 to Rs147.51 per litre. Petrol is mainly used in private transportation, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers. Higher fuel prices significantly impact the budgets of the members of the middle and lower-middle classes, who primarily consume petrol for commuting. On the other hand, a significant portion of the transport sector relies on high-speed diesel. Its price is considered inflationary since it is predominantly used in heavy goods transport vehicles, trucks, buses, trains, and agricultural machinery such as tractors, tube wells, and threshers. The consumption of high-speed diesel particularly contributes to the increased prices of vegetables and other food items.","business"
"148","Trump's transition team aims to kill Biden EV tax credit","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574479-trumps-transition-team-aims-to-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit","President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter toldReuters. Ending the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling US EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla — by far the nation's biggest EV maker — have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of Trump's biggest backers and the world's richest person, said in July that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would be ""devastating"" to its US EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors. Shares of Tesla ended nearly 6% lower at $311.18, while shares of smaller EV rival Rivian closed down 14% at $10.31. Lucid, another EV maker, tumbled 5% to $2.08. Repealing the subsidy, a signature measure of Democratic President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and Republican North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said. The group has met several times since Trump's November 5 election victory, including at his Florida Mar-a-Lago club, where Musk has also spent considerable time since the election. Representatives of Tesla and Ford did not respond to requests for comment. GM and Stellantis declined to comment. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged Congress in an October 15 letter to retain the EV tax credits, calling them ""critical to cementing the US as a global leader"" in future auto manufacturing. The Trump transition team did not comment on the fate of the EV tax credit but said in a statement that the president-elect would deliver on ""promises he made on the campaign trail."" Trump campaigned on ending Biden's ""EV mandate,"" without spelling out specific targeted policies. The energy-focused transition team has determined some of Biden's clean-energy policies will be tough to end because they are popular and already funnelling money to Republican-dominated states, the sources said. The team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump could use the cost savings from killing the credit to help pay for the extension of trillions of dollars in tax cuts from his first term that are set to expire soon, the two sources said. Congressional Republicans plan to take up the broader tax bill as one of their first actions. Energy transition team members expect the Republican Congress will deploy a legislative measure known as reconciliation to avoid relying on Democratic votes. Biden used the same tactic to pass the IRA. Killing EV tax credits is strongly supported by Hamm, a long-time Trump supporter, along with the broader oil-and-gas industry. Trump promised while campaigning to boost US oil production, even as it has hit record highs, and to roll back Biden’s clean-energy initiatives, which also include subsidies for wind and solar power and the mass production of hydrogen.","business"
"149","National fiscal pact: IMF asks provinces for timeline on HEC, BISP funding contribution","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574483-national-fiscal-pact-imf-asks-provinces-for-timeline-on-hec-bisp-funding-contribution","ISLAMABAD: Amid concerns raised over failure of the federating units, especially Punjab, to generate the desired revenue surplus, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission sought exact timelines from provinces for their contributions to spending on the higher education and Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) programme for curtailing expenditures. The National Fiscal Pact (NFP) was signed by the Centre and four provinces just ahead of getting approval from the IMF’s Executive Board under $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) as five governments agreed upon a fiscal framework for raising revenues, sharing expenditures and improving governance. The visiting IMF mission continued deliberations with Pakistani authorities here on Thursday and they were now heading towards the conclusion with the expectation that both sides would conclude parleys on Friday (today). It is expected that the IMF may prefer to issue a press statement at the conclusion of five days of talks, starting from November 11 and concluding on November 15. The IMF reviewed progress on Public Investment Management (PIMA) and Climate-PIMA on Wednesday night and Thursday morning as Islamabad already requested for additional $1 billion in funding from the IMF under Climate Finance for augmentation of loans from $7 to $8 billion. Under C-PIMA, the government will produce a report detailing the outcomes of our review of all investment projects in the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) by December 2024. The findings from this review will enable streamlining of the PSDP pipeline by developing a prioritisation mechanism for existing projects, identifying those suitable for capping or cancellation. Moreover, to enhance its project selection framework, the government would publish on the website the criteria for the project selection including a scorecard, detailing the weight assigned to each criterion and the methodology for calculating the score, along with an annual limit on the total size of new projects entering the PSDP portfolio by end-January 2025 Structural Benchmark (SB). The IMF raised serious concerns over the failure of the provinces to generate an agreed revenue surplus during the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Against the target of Rs342 billion, the target of revenue surplus met with failure with slippages of Rs160 billion during the first three months of the current fiscal year. The IMF sought progress on six key revenue generation points as all the provinces agreed to amend the Agricultural Income Tax (AIT) regimes to fully align them, through necessary legislative changes, with Federal Personal Income (small farmers) and Corporate Income (Commercial Agriculture) tax regimes by end-October 2024 and begin taxation of agricultural income under this new regime from January 1, 2025, with collection for second half of FY2024-25 agricultural income in July 2025. Secondly, the provinces will ensure transition of the services GST from a positive list to a negative list approach to combat tax evasion to take effect from the start of FY2025-26. Thirdly, they aim to collectively raise revenues from corporate tax in agriculture and GST on services combined with provincial tax efforts in expanding additional areas of revenue collection. Fourthly, they will develop, implement, and collect revenue under a common approach to property taxation. Fifthly, all provinces will implement the necessary administrative reforms to narrow the tax compliance gap, including for the GST. Sixthly, the provinces would agree that the National Tax Council’s terms of reference would be expanded to include the design of the relevant tax measures including property tax, and the necessary legal and administrative changes to implement them. For spending measures, the provinces agreed upon key points as provinces would provide additional contributions for higher education to the federal government supported initiatives of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) federal and provincial governments would gradually rebuild spending on health and education programmes as a share of GDP. The federal government, in consultation with provincial governments, would examine social protection programmes rolled out/planned by the provincial governments and the BISP respectively, to identify overlapping programmes and fiscal allocations, and take fiscally prudent measures accordingly, in ways which strengthen and improve generosity and coverage of social protection. Provinces will cover all of PSDP spending, which benefits solely one province and any spending by the federal government in areas allocated to provinces in the 18th Amendment as per the decision of the National Economic Council (NEC), with certain exceptions to be determined by NEC based on well-defined criteria. Provinces should discontinue announcing support prices (for raw commodities) and also discontinue procurement operations. The federal government should reduce its footprint in line with the 18th Amendment. If needed, matters requiring federal and provincial consensus and coordination may be referred to the forum of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) or NEC. The IMF asks all provinces to implement the National Fiscal Pact in letter and spirit. The provinces in return demanded the IMF that there should be a policy dealing with the revenue surplus instead of just posting numbers to show improved fiscal numbers at the federal level.

"150","PSX sustains record-setting pace driven by upbeat economic outlook","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574462-psx-maintains-high-amid-positive-economic-sentiment","   Stocks extended their winning streak on Friday, hitting a new all-time  high after briefly crossing 95,000 mark, as upbeat developments, including strong forex data and the unlikelihood of an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-dictated mini-budget, fuelled a strong risk-on rally. The Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Shares Index soared to a record high of 94,763.64 points, up 571.75 points, from the previous close of 94,191.89 points, after flirting with an intraday high of 95,278.26 points. The market’s upward momentum underscores a growing wave of investor confidence fueled by encouraging economic indicators. Reacting to the bull run, Ahsan Mehanti, Managing Director & CEO at Arif Habib Commodities, said stocks reached a new all-time high amid receding fears over mini-budget and Islamabad High Court (IHC) relief on banking sector tax levies. “Falling bank lending rates and rupee stability contributed to the ongoing rally at the capital market,” Mehanti added. Central bank-held foreign exchange reserves reached a more than two-year high of $11.26 billion as of November 8, while the rupee also rose for the second straight day on Thursday as exporters’ dollar sales and remittances exceeded importers’ demand. Reports suggest the IMF has raised no concerns about Pakistan meeting its revenue collection targets, easing fears of a mini-budget or new taxation measures. This has bolstered investor sentiment and increased trading activity across sectors. The mission, led by its mission chief Nathan Porter, is visiting Pakistan to hash out recent developments and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme performance to date. After meetings with Pakistani authorities, the IMF staff has reportedly given a thumbs-up to an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio by nearly 1.5 percentage points — a significant achievement by the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR). Topline Securities in its market commentary said the banking sector got a boost following the IHC decision to temporarily bar the government from collecting an additional tax of up to 15% from banks on private sector borrowing below the target. In terms of traded value, Pakistan State Oil (Rs2.86 billion), Attock Refinery Limited (Rs2.24 billion), TRG Pakistan (Rs1.76 billion), Hub Power Company (Rs1.3 billion), and Oil and Gas Development Company (Rs1.29 billion) dominated the trading activity at the PSX, the report added. It noted that major contributors to the index were United Bank Limited, Habib Bank Limited, and Meezan Bank Limited, which collectively added 301 points to the benchmark. In the pharmaceutical sector, The Searle Company Limited was the most actively traded stock, with 12.6 million shares worth Rs1.08 billion changing hands. Decent participation was observed in the market, with traded volumes standing at 892 million shares and the traded value amounting to Rs30.8 billion. WorldCall Telecom Limited emerged as the volume leader with 78 million shares traded.","business"

The Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index surged by 836.47 points or 0.9%, reaching a record high of 94,191.89 points, after touching an intraday high of 94,289.97 points. Khurram Schehzad, CEO of Alpha Beta Core, suggests that investor optimism is being driven by the IMF team’s ongoing smooth review, pushing the market into uncharted territory. Schehzad notes that this raises the likelihood of Pakistan successfully completing the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme. The IMF mission, which arrived in Islamabad on November 11, after meetings with Pakistani authorities, has reportedly given a thumbs-up to an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio by nearly 1.5 percentage points — a significant achievement by the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR). This improvement means there’s no immediate need for additional tax measures through a supplementary finance bill. It must be noted that the IMF had previously set a target for Pakistan to boost its tax revenues by 1.5% of GDP in the fiscal year 2024-25, targeting a total increase of 3% throughout the 37-month programme. Last week,The Newsreported that an IMF delegation would hold talks with Pakistan next week following major ""deviations"" on performance targets and might urge Islamabad to bring out a mini-budget for ""course correction"". The unscheduled visit and talks are too early for the first IMF review  — due in the first quarter of 2025. Commenting on the rally, Ahsan Mehanti Managing Director & CEO at Arif Habib Commodities, said stocks hit a new all-time high led by blue chip scrips on strong earnings' outlook down the line. ""Rupee stability, receding fears over mini-budget and falling bank lending rates spurred a strong bull-run at the country's capital market,"" Mehanti added. It was a blue-chip-buying fest today as sectors, such as commercial banks, oil and gas exploration, oil marketing companies, and power generation, stole the show. Major support came from heavyweights, including MCB Bank, Meezan Bank Limited, National Bank of Pakistan, Hub Power Company, Mari Petroleum Company, Oil & Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited. Topline Securities credited the uptrend to growing economic optimism after positive IMF remarks mitigated the frets over potential new taxation measures. ""Investor interest surged in the banking sector following news that Pakistani banks secured temporary relief from the Islamabad High Court against a government tax linked to shortfalls in private sector lending,"" the brokerage said in a note. It added that this relief would remain in effect until a final decision was reached, with hearings scheduled to commence on December 3, 2024.","business"
"152","Govt to introduce major reforms to tackle power sector's woes: minister","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574309-govt-to-introduce-major-reforms-to-tackle-power-sectors-woes-minister","ISLAMABAD: Power Minister Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that in order to address the power sector's long-standing energy woes, the government will introduce transformative reforms to tackle inefficiency, costly power generation, and poor planning,The Newsreported on Thursday. Leghari, while speaking at a seminar hosted by the British High Commission, chalked out bold steps, including the introduction of the Independent System Market Operator (ISMO) and its operationalisation in March 2025 and the privatisation of distribution companies (Discos), aimed at reshaping the sector into a competitive, transparent market. ""Reforms in the energy sector face significant hurdles due to the current economic situation,"" said the minister while acknowledging the challenges posed by economic pressures on the energy sector. Criticising the historical lack of strategic planning in the power sector, which has led to the country’s reliance on expensive electricity generation, he said: ""Pakistan has never invested in power generation based on a least-cost methodology. Instead, we've consistently bought costly power with opaque pricing models, and we're still dealing with the fallout from past IPP contracts."" Leghari highlighted the upcoming addition of 17,000 megawatts to Pakistan's energy portfolio, yet only 87MW meets the required least-cost criteria. ""Every other MW being added is a violation of the least-cost methodology,"" he stated, adding that the government is currently reviewing the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), with the aim of approving a new 10-year plan within a month. The power minister also expressed concerns over the country's net-metering system, which, though adding 1.2 gigawatts to the grid, has placed an undue financial burden on the system. ""Only 100,000 affluent individuals benefit from net metering, but the entire population bears the cost. The system needs to be rationalised, as the country simply cannot afford the current model,"" he said. In addressing the inefficiencies of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), the minister described it as ""one of the most inefficient companies Pakistan has ever had,"" pointing to years of delays in national transmission projects. He confirmed that plans are underway to split NTDC into three companies to improve its efficiency. Leghari also revealed that a major reform in the energy sector, the Independent System Market Operator (ISMO), through the restructuring of NTDC has been approved and is set to become operational in March 2025. This will pave the way for bilateral contracts between power buyers and sellers, with the government no longer serving as the sole purchaser of electricity. ""This entity will be responsible for creating an efficient, comprehensive, and transparent competitive electricity market for consumers,"" he explained. The privatisation of distribution companies, or Discos, is another key element of the reform agenda. The minister, who is in charge of 11 distribution companies with over 200,000 employees, is confident that the privatisation will replicate the success seen in the telecom sector. ""We have brought in good professional boards for Discos, for the first time in the country’s history without any political or judicial or establishment or bureaucratic intervention. And hence what results we got out of it. We had a review with the IMF only yesterday or the day before, and our first quarter's circular debt management plan targets, we did Rs170 billion better than what was actually budgeted,” he noted. Furthermore, the federal minister highlighted key issues facing Pakistan's economy, including a growing population, health crises, water shortages, and deficiencies in the education system. ""We need investment in water storage and distribution systems,"" he noted. He stressed the need for reforms in the social protection system to enhance transparency and inclusion, which would empower communities and improve governance. ""Local governments are the foundation of democracy, but they lack constitutional protection in Pakistan,"" he remarked.","business"
"153","IMF expresses concerns over $1.2bn Saudi oil facility","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574308-imf-expresses-concerns-over-12bn-saudi-oil-facility","ISLAMABAD: The visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission has raised concerns about the execution of the $1.2 billion Saudi Oil Facility (SOF) amid worries that Saudi Arabia may condition the disbursement on progress in the multi-billion-dollar Reko Diq project, potentially leading to delays,The Newsreported. Saudi Arabia had initially assured the IMF of the $1.2 billion SOF as part of Pakistan’s $7 billion bailout package, approved by the IMF’s Executive Board a few months ago. However, the IMF now fears the oil facility may face hurdles, although a delegation from the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) is expected to visit Islamabad next month. However, the sources close to the Prime Minister’s Office reveal that Pakistan possessed a Plan-B, which excludes the SOF, but they did not share its details. In another blow, Pakistan has missed out a Structural Benchmark (SB) for amending the Agriculture Income Tax (AIT) by the four legislating assemblies under the IMF condition till end October 2024. Although, the provincial cabinets already granted their nod, but, so far, the provincial assemblies had not yet approved the piece of legislation. Pakistan might have to seek a waiver from the IMF’s Executive Board on this slippage of implementing the SB within the stipulated timeframe. The IMF explicitly wrote in its staff report that “provincial tax reforms will include the (i) full alignment of their AIT regimes with the federal personal and corporate income taxes by October 2024 (end-October SB) with implementation from January 1, 2025 and collection in July 2025”. The IMF has pointed out a risk to $2.6 billion for securing external financing arising out of a potential gap for the current fiscal year. The IMF Staff Mission is becoming stricter in the wake of Executive Board members assessments whereby “directors noted the Ex-post Peer Review assessment and the negative impact caused by deviations from programmed policies, and stressed the importance of strong ownership for programme implementation and financing. They emphasised the need for effective communication to build broad consensus and support for reforms”. Meanwhile, in another development, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial requested the Senate panel on finance for holding an in camera session when Senator Faisal Sabzwari asked about mini budget under the IMF conditionalities. The MQM-Pakistan senator stated that he was interested to know whether the AIT was going to be slapped as currently the amount collected through traffic challan in metropolitan Karachi was higher than the collection of the AIT in his province. The FBR chairman replied that the discussions were underway with the IMF, so it would be appropriate to hold briefing on this issue in camera in next meeting. Senate Standing Committee on Finance Chairman Saleem Mandviwalla said that the media gets annoyed with in camera sessions but agreed to the request made by the FBR chairman for holding in camera briefing on IMF programme and mini budget. The Ministry of Finance and the IMF high-ups continued parleys on Wednesday and in the first session the external financing gap came under discussion. The Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs Division and State Bank of Pakistan informed the IMF that the China had struck currency swap deal of 3 billion Yuan (approximately $450 million) but they did not entertain the request to increase the currency swap limits. On Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB), the IMF was told that there was a link of $500 million guarantee from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and things would be finalised soon. In the second session, the Ministry of Finance briefed the IMF on domestic borrowing plan envisaging that the debt servicing cost would be reduced in the aftermath of reduction in policy rate from 22 to 15 percent. It would save Rs1.3 trillion in debt servicing bill. The FBR high-ups claimed that the envisaged tax collection target of Rs12,970 billion would remain unchanged, without explaining that how the tax shortfall occurred in the first four months of Rs189 billion would be bridged in remaining period of the current fiscal year. They also said that the GST on petroleum products would not be slapped. It’s true because it would become part of the federal divisible pool and 60 percent collected amount can be transferred to the provinces under NFC Award. The option is to jack up petroleum levy. The FBR high-ups argued that they fetched Rs11.84 billion from retailers in first four months as the number of filers went up from 218,015 in tax year 2023 to 607,685 in 2024 and paid-up tax increased from Rs5.3 billion in last tax year to Rs9.3 billion so far in 2024. The increase in tax collection stood at Rs4.076 billion. Under Withholding (WHT) compliance, the retailers/ wholesalers paid up Rs6.7 billion under section 236G of Income Tax Law in 2024 against Rs3.18 billion in tax year 2023. Under 236H, the retailers paid tax of Rs9.799 billion in 2024 compared to Rs5.6 billion in 2023.","business"

The notice, issued on Wednesday, follows KE’s inability to provide comprehensive data on rejected net-metering applications, which KE attributed to system overloads. Nepra considers this a violation of its regulations and the Nepra Act. The issue surfaced after multiple reports indicated that KE had declined numerous net-metering requests, citing overloaded common distribution systems and Pole-Mounted Transformers (PMTs) as the cause. Nepra initially directed KE to submit specific data regarding these rejections in May 2024, but the utility provider requested an extension and failed to meet compliance standards within the stipulated timeline. Following an explanation letter from Nepra in July, KE provided partial information, stating that net-metering requests exceeding 80% of transformer capacity required upgrades at the applicants’ expense. However, Nepra deemed KE’s submission unsatisfactory, noting that it did not adhere to the requirements for transparency and timely consumer access to net-metering services. The Authority has now formally determined KE’s response inadequate, issuing the show cause notice under Nepra’s fine regulations. The notice compels KE to address the non-compliance and submit a comprehensive explanation for its actions regarding the handling of consumer applications for net-metering, a key program supporting renewable energy adoption in Pakistan. In response KE says since the inception of the net metering policy it has successfully energised over 18,000 connections and continues to do so as part of its ongoing efforts.

"155","Selling 4% of IMF's gold could provide debt relief to 86 countries: study","https://www.geo.tv/latest/574225-selling-4-of-imfs-gold-could-provide-debt-relief-to-86-countries-study","In order to help offer debt relief to low income countries devastated by climate-related catastrophes, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should sell 4% of its gold, a study said as climate financing dominates early talks at the COP29 summit. Selling 4% of the Washington-based lender's gold would generate $9.52 billion, the study said, covering debt relief for 86 countries. From the Caribbean to Africa, low income countries have turned to the IMF in recent years for support in the face of shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic, driving up repayments to the lender of last resort in subsequent years. Although the IMF has a facility known as Catastrophe Containment Relief Trust (CCRT), this only covers 30 poor countries and has just $103 million available, said researchers from the Boston University Global Development Centre. The CCRT is used to pay off an eligible member state's loans to the IMF for up to two years, providing immediate relief and allowing those funds to be targeted at other priorities. ""Many climate-vulnerable countries have been unable to access the CCRT as its eligibility criteria fails to account for climate vulnerability ... and funding is severely limited,"" the researchers said in a report. The solution lies in selling some of the IMF's 90.5 million ounces of gold reserves, the report said, taking advantage of elevated prices to boost the fund and cover more countries. ""With current gold prices exceeding $2,600 per ounce, selling a small fraction of gold has the potential to generate significant revenues and easily replenish the CCRT,"" it said. Gold was trading at $2,606.42 per ounce on Wednesday. IMF gold reserve sales are rare. The last was in 2009/10, when it offloaded an eighth of its reserves, which was triggered by the need to boost its lending capacity. At its inception in 1944, member states used to pay their IMF quotas with gold, the research report said, meaning it accumulated reserves at a historical cost of just $45 per ounce. Repayments of IMF loans are taking a bigger chunk of annual debt servicing costs for vulnerable economies, the report said. The Indian Ocean island of Madagascar will pay $106 million to the IMF next year, a quarter of its debt service, rising to $158 million and 41% in 2026, the report added. Mozambique will also experience an increase in repayments to the IMF during a similar period, the researchers found. Any sale of IMF gold would require support from the bulk of its executive board members, and for member states to pledge to channel their share of the proceeds to the CCRT, they said. ""Replenishing the CCRT should be considered a high priority because, in contrast to other IMF lending programs, the CCRT comes with no conditionality,"" they concluded.","business"

The tax-collecting authority, in a statement, said that the system was guided by the government's vision to modernise Pakistan's tax infrastructure. ""FBR is reinforcing its commitment to advancing tax administration and enhancing revenue collection through advanced digital solutions,"" it said, adding that the system, named ePayment 2.0, is available within the IRIS 2.0 portal. The system would be accessible directly from taxpayers' bank accounts via internet banking, ATMs, and mobile banking, eliminating the need for physical bank visits. ePayment 2.0 marks a significant advancement in revenue management, covering a wide range of taxes, including income tax, sales tax, federal excise duty, and withholding taxes, said the FBR. The authority highlighted that the taxpayers used a separate ePayment system outside IRIS 2.0 previously, requiring them to switch between portals. However, the FBR has now provided a unified and improved user interface accessible directly within IRIS 2.0. ""By generating a unique Payment Slip ID (PSID), it enables quick and convenient payments for both registered and unregistered taxpayers. Upon payment completion, a computerised payment receipt (CPR) is issued via email and SMS, providing official confirmation and easy access for future use within the IRIS 2.0 system,"" said the statement. The statement also said that through a secure, precise multi-step workflow, the system allows taxpayers to generate a PSID, complete payment through ADC channels and receive a CPR in real-time, accessible for future compliance needs within IRIS. ""To enhance transparency and accountability, it includes comprehensive PSID search feature, allowing taxpayers to easily retrieve and confirm payment records.

As per Arif Habib Limited, the domestic debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 43.1%, while the external debt-to-GDP ratio was recorded at 22.7%. The data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) shows that the government's debt has witnessed a drop of Rs792 billion or 1% month-on-month in September, underscoring the government’s reduced financing needs resulting from the budget surplus, record-high central bank profits, and prudent expense management. The government's total debt stock fell to Rs69.57 trillion by the end of September 2024, down from Rs70.362 trillion at the end of August 2024. However, the debt increased by Rs656 billion in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. As of June 30, 2024, the debt stood at Rs68.914 trillion. The latest debt figures come amid the ongoing talks between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with the latter's team in Islamabad to evaluate the country’s progress on the $7 billion loan programme. The primary agenda of the IMF team is to assess Pakistan’s external financing gap and the measures being taken to address the shortfall in tax collection. Furthermore, the SBP data reveals that the government's domestic debt rose to Rs47.536 trillion in the first quarter of FY25, an increase from Rs47.16 trillion at the end of the last fiscal year. However, on a month-on-month basis, the domestic debt declined and was recorded at Rs48.339 trillion at the end of August. Additionally, the government’s external debt increased to Rs22.034 trillion during the July-September FY25 period, compared to Rs21.754 trillion at the end of June. At the end of August 2024, the external debt stood at Rs22.023 trillion. ""Government debt has increased at its slowest pace in the first quarter since the first quarter of the fiscal year 2022. This deceleration in debt growth is attributed to the government’s first fiscal surplus in 20 years, recorded in the first quarter of this fiscal year,” said AKD Securities Limited Director Research Awais Ashraf. ""The government reported a record primary surplus of Rs3 trillion and a fiscal surplus of Rs1.7 trillion for the first quarter,"" he added. ""This positive outcome was driven by a historic Rs2.5 trillion in dividends received from the State Bank of Pakistan and a significant 26% increase in tax revenue collected by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) along with prudent management on the expenses front,"" Ashraf noted. Meanwhile, Ismail Iqbal Securities head of research Saad Hanif is of the view that central government debt rose from Rs62.3 trillion in September 2023 to Rs69.6 trillion in September 2024, with a focus on long-term debt. ""While domestic borrowing increased, the government favoured long-term debt, actively buying back Treasury bills and extending short-term debt into longer maturities. ""External debt remained stable with minor increases, and a slightly stronger Pakistani rupee softened its impact in rupee terms. This shift toward long-term debt could provide more stability and reduce refinancing risks, although overall debt levels continue to rise,"" he said. Additionally, SBP statistics show that Pakistan’s debt and liabilities increased to Rs85.836 trillion in the July-September FY25 period. This is up from Rs78.419 trillion during the same period last year. In terms of dollars, the country’s total external debt and liabilities rose to $133.4 billion for the July-September FY25, compared with $131 billion at the end of June and $129.76 billion at the end of September 2023. The public external debt amounted to $100.619 billion as of September 30, 2024. The central bank has told analysts following the monetary policy meeting last week that the overall debt stock has declined, and debt composition has improved. In addition, the maturity profile of these debts has also improved due to the increase in the share of multilateral debts. The domestic outstanding debt profile has also improved as the share of short-term treasury bills has declined to 21 per cent in four months of FY25, compared with 24% at the end of FY24. The authorities expect this share to go below 20% by the end of FY25. The reduction in interest rates, as per the SBP, and the timely use of surplus funds for debt profiling are expected to significantly lower the government’s debt servicing costs in fiscal year 2025. The government's total interest expense for FY25 is now estimated to be Rs8.5 trillion, compared with Rs9.8 trillion projected in the budget for the current fiscal year. This reduction results in total savings of Rs1.3 trillion, which is approximately 1.0% of gross domestic product. These savings will help in controlling the fiscal deficit for FY25. The SBP believes the gross financing requirements are expected to be met. Out of a total of $26.1 billion in external repayments for FY25, the country has to repay $6.3 billion in the remaining eight months of the current fiscal year.","business"
"159","Cut expenditures or unveil mini-budget, IMF tells Pakistan","https://www.geo.tv/latest/573964-cut-expenditures-or-unveil-mini-budget-imf-tells-pakistan","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Finance Mohammad Aurangzeb has initiated discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is urging Pakistan to enhance its revenue collection, as reported byThe Newson Tuesday. The publication reported that the IMF is suggesting two options — either unveil a mini-budget to meet the revenue shortfall of Rs189 billion or come up with a viable plan to reduce the unbridled expenditures. Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal and Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial started the first session with the visiting IMF team scheduled to stay in Islamabad from November 11 to 15. It remains to be seen how the IMF responds but satisfying the IMF over its concerns seems to be a difficult undertaking. The finance minister has informed the IMF that the country’s tax machinery collected Rs11 billion from retailers, wholesalers, and distributors in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the much-hyped Tajir Dost Scheme (TDS) has miserably failed to get the desired results as the tax collected through this scheme stands at just Rs1.7 million by the latest available figures against the agreed target of Rs10 billion for the first quarter. A top official said the TDS was just an instrument to bring retailers and wholesalers into the tax net but its objective has been achieved as the FBR managed to collect an additional Rs11 billion from them in the first quarter through the normal taxation regime. Under sections 236G and 236H of the Income Tax law, the FBR hiked the tax rates for selling products to non-filers by almost 10 times so keeping in view stringent actions and fear factors the retailers and wholesalers preferred to come into the tax net and deposited additional tax of Rs11 billion till September 30, 2024. The number of return filers has also gone up substantially so the process of documentation of economy has gained momentum in the country. Under section 236G related to advance tax on sales to distributors, dealers and wholesalers, every manufacturer or commercial importer at the time of sale to distributors, dealers, and wholesalers, shall collect advance tax at the rate specified in Division XIV of Part IV of the First Schedule, from the aforesaid person to whom such sales have been made. This rate is fixed at 2% on the gross amount of sale to distributors, dealers or wholesalers other than the sale of fertiliser. Credit for tax collected under sub-section (1) shall be allowed in computing the tax due by the distributor, dealer, or wholesaler on the taxable income for the tax year in which the tax was collected. Under section 236H related to advance tax on sales to retailers, every manufacturer, distributor, dealer, wholesaler or commercial importer at the time of sale to retailers, and every distributor or dealer to another wholesaler in respect of the said sectors"", shall collect advance tax at the rate specified in Division XV of Part IV of the First Schedule, from the aforesaid person to whom such sales have been made. This rate is fixed at 2.5% on the gross amount of sales to retailers. Credit for the tax collected under sub-section (1) shall be allowed in computing the tax due by the retailer on the taxable income for the tax year in which the tax was collected. The Power Division high-ups briefed the IMF on the imposition of increased fixed rates for on-grid solar energy which will lead to curtailing of solarisation. The power division seeks the IMF’s green light on this proposal. The Fund’s Staff Mission is in the country for meetings to suggest midway course correction to avoid deviations from the fiscal and external framework envisaged for the current fiscal year. The IMF preferred to visit Islamabad earlier than conducting the first review under the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility mainly because of fiscal slippages in the first four months. There were apprehensions that if the course correction was not done immediately, then the fiscal hole might widen further and touch irreparable levels by Feb-March 2025. The IMF might not rely on cutting down expenditure heads which will have limited space so the more viable option might be the unveiling of a mini-budget for jacking up the tax to GDP ratio up to the desired level, said the official.","business"

The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has now more than doubled from the year's low of $38,505 and was last at $81,572 having earlier touched a record high of $81,899. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Other so-called 'Trump trades' — from US stocks to shorting bonds have lost some steam since the election, but cryptocurrencies haven't paused for breath. ""Bitcoin's Trump-pump is alive and well... with Republicans on the cusp of taking the house to confirm a red wave in Congress, it seems the crypto crowd are betting on digital-currency deregulation,"" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, referring to Republican control of both houses. While Simpson warned Trump's near-term priorities are likely to lie elsewhere, crypto investors see an end to stepped-up scrutiny under US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler whom Trump has said he will fire. The cryptocurrency industry spent more than $119 million backing pro-crypto congressional candidates and has, by and large, succeeded. In Ohio, one of the crypto industry's biggest foes in Congress — Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown was ousted, while pro-crypto candidates from both the Democratic and Republican parties won in Michigan, West Virgina, Indiana, Alabama and North Carolina. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial in September, and although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a friendly signal. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Eric Trump, one of the president-elect's sons and executive vice president of his private conglomerate, The Trump Organisation, is a keynote speaker at a bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi next month, according to the event organisers. Gains in cryptocurrencies have been broad. Ether rose above $3,200 for the first time in over three months on Monday and was last fetching $3,192.

""The government would pay the said 18 IPPs in the shape of cash or T-bills the past dues in the head of energy charges and capacity payments but they would not be paid interest payments,"" said power sector industry and government officials. The said IPPs have the cumulative capacity to generate electricity of 4,267 megawatts and were set up under 1994 and 2002 power policies. The move will allow Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's administration to save around Rs70 to Rs100 billion per year amid prevailing various challenges faced by the country on the economic front. The government would pay only against the actual electricity dispatch under ""take and pay"" mode and IPPs would not be paid capacity payments at all. However, the government has assured the IPPs that it would also pay the annual expenditures enough to keep the power plants afloat to ensure their existence in the system. The development comes after the publication, back in September, reported that the incumbent government had decided to treat the state-run and privately-owned IPPs in the same way with regards to making them operational on take-and-pay mode. ""We have decided to get the government out of the electric power business. The powerhouses owned by the government generating 52% of electricity would also be shifted to take-and-pay mode. The government would finance them only to make them operational,"" said an official back then was was among the top functionaries serving as members of the task force on power sector reforms. ""The electricity would be purchased from government power plants based on take-and-pay mode. The payment would be made only for electricity to be purchased. Return on Equity is to be paid on a take-and-pay basis,"" he added. Notably, the 18 IPPs that would be made operational now under take-and-pay mode are Uch-I Power Limited of 586 MWs, Pakgen Power Limited of 365 MWs, Liberty Power Daharki Ltd 235 MWs, Kohinoor Energy 131 MWs, Fauji Kabirwala Power Company Limited 157 MWs, Attock Gen Limited (165 MWs), Engro Power Gen Qadirpur Limited 227 MWs, Foundation Power (Daharki) of 185 MWs, Halmore Power Generation Company 225 MWs, Liberty Power Tech Limited 200 MWs, Liberty Power Tech Limited 225 MWs, Narowal Energy Tech Limited 220 MWs, Nishat Chunian Power Limited 200 MWs, Nishat Power Limited 200 MWs, Orient Power Company 229 MWs, Saif Power Limited 229 MWs, Laraib Energy Limited 84 MWs and Uch-II Power Project of 404 MWs. The government would continue to purchase electricity from the 18 IPPs under the take-and-pay mode until the private power market is established. Meanwhile,  in the head of operation and maintenance (O&M) cost, the government would continue to bail out the IPPs. Once the deal with 18 IPPs is done, then the Task Force on Power would turn to the government power plants (GPPs) that include LNG-based power projects, generation companies (Gencos), provincial government plants, nuclear and hydropower power projects and they would also be treated as IPPs and become operational under ""take and pay"" mode.","business"

The Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Shares Index closed at 93,648.32 points, up 356.64 points or 0.38% from the previous close of 93,291.68 points, after hitting an intraday high of 94,020.02 points. Talking toGeo.tv, Ahsan Mehanti from Arif Habib Corp said stocks reached an all-time high, driven by blue-chip scrips, drawing foreign investors interest after the MSCI standard index weight was revised to 4.4%. ""Rupee stability and declining bank lending rates, following a slump in government bond yields, also spurred the bullish activity at the PSX,"" Mehanti added. Last week, the MSCI announced changes in its global indices’ constituents, effective after the market close on November 25, 2024. The MSCI small cap index has 399 constituents, out of which 67 (17% of the total) are from Pakistan with a weight of 10.5%. Raza Jafri, CEO at EFG Hermes Pakistan, toldGeo. tvthat the energy sector was contributing most to the index's rise, complemented by a catch-up rise in some hitherto underperforming high beta stocks. ""So far, the market is defying nascent calls [for] a technical correction but it remains possible given the index's rapid ascent this quarter,"" the capital market expert said. Moreover, market analysts have credited the recent upward momentum to a series of favourable macroeconomic factors. These include the State Bank of Pakistan's unprecedented 250 basis points reduction in the policy rate, bringing it down to 15%. Remittances also reached $3.1 billion in October 2024, offering further support to the nation's economy. Moreover, the cut-off yields for the fixed-rate discounted (FRD) and fixed rental rate (FRR) Sukuk saw a marked decrease. The one-year FRD yield dropped 76 basis points to 10.99%. In the FRR category, cut-off yields fell to 11.5% for the three-year (-50bps), 12.1% for the five-year (-43bps), and 11.7% for the 10-year (-104bps) Sukuk bonds. Samiullah Tariq, Group Head of Research and Product Development at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company, attributed the rally to a strategic shift by money market funds from debt securities to equities. ""This transition is driven by declining interest rates and an improved economic outlook, making equities more attractive to investors,"" Tariq said. Nonetheless, Intermarket Securities Limited in a report said that the key triggers to watch for the market would be the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission's meeting this week.

This process harmed the entire privatisation effort,” said the former minister speaking on the Geo News programme Jirga. The federal government’s latest attempt to privatise its struggling national airline fell through after the sole bidder, Blue World City, offered just Rs10 billion for a 60% stake in PIA, far below the minimum asking price of Rs85 billion, and flatly refused further negotiations. Following approval from the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation, the final auction of the loss-making PIA was held on October 30. This bid failure marks Pakistan’s second attempt in a decade to divest the national flag carrier, with a similar effort ending prematurely in 2015, reported The News. During the talk show, Fawad said that a “lack of decision-making” was the reason behind the failure to attract potential bidders for PIA. “The privatisation process can’t be completed until you make the right decision at the right time.” Highlighting his achievements, the former minister added, “For the first time in [Pakistan’s] history, we initiated the privatisation of PIA. There was no meaningful work in this regard before September 2023.” Fawad said that during the initial four weeks, he realised the aviation division was not serious about the privatisation of PIA. “Hence, I took direct financial control of PIA,” he added. “We completed the restructuring of PIA,” he said, noting that he reprofiled PIA’s Rs281 billion debt borrowed from local and international banks, capping it at 12% after negotiations. “We saved Rs35 billion per annum due to the renegotiation,” he added. Speaking on the show, former finance minister Miftah Ismail said, “Neither [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif has any track record of undertaking privatisation [of any state-owned entity] nor any intention.” Responding to a question, the former minister claimed that the PM and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar were also not serious about privatisation. Criticising the current PML-N government, he said, “We don’t know how to run a police station; what is the need to operate an airline?” Reacting to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab governments' interest in acquiring PIA, the former finance minister, earlier this month, said there were no state-run airlines anywhere around the globe. ""No government in the world operates airlines,"" Miftah had said as he came down hard on provincial governments’ proposals to buy the national carrier while speaking at the Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’. In a letter to Privatisation Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, the KP’s Board of Investment and Trade (BOIT) said that they were prepared to offer a bid that would surpass the current highest offer of Rs10 billion. Later, following the KP suit, the Maryam Nawaz-led Punjab government also expressed interest in acquiring the national carrier. Taking to PML-N supporters in New York, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif said that his daughter Minister urged him to purchase the PIA and rebrand it as “Air Punjab”. Commenting on these developments, Miftah said that he didn’t know any province had an airline. “A province's responsibility is to provide education, health and convenience to the people,” he said regretting that the provinces “do not collect a penny of tax but seek financial assistance from the Centre"". Responding to a question regarding the PIA privatisation fiasco, the former finance minister had claimed that it came with “such pre-requisitions” which discouraged buyers.","business"

The digital currency passed $80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12pm (1200 GMT). It has been rising since Republican candidate Trump won last Tuesday's US presidential election over sentiment that he will ease regulations on digital currencies. Bitcoin reached $75,000 on Wednesday, topping its previous all-time peak of $73,797.98 achieved in March. Trump was seen as the pro-crypto candidate in his battle with the Democratic Party's candidate Kamala Harris. During his first presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, even launching his own platform for the unit. He has pledged to make the United States the ""bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world,"" and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste. The previous Trump term saw corporate tax cuts that brought more liquidity to markets, encouraging investment into high-growth assets such as cryptocurrency. Trump announced in September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch a digital currency platform named World Liberty Financial. But it had a faltering sales launch earlier this month, with only a fraction of its tokens that went on the market finding a buyer. Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform. In the run-up to the election, Trump apparently became the first former president to use bitcoin in a purchase, as he bought burgers at a New York City restaurant, which hailed it as a ""historic transaction"".

""The NTDC has long been plagued by mismanagement, but we are introducing sweeping changes to improve the sector,"" said Federal Energy Minister Awais Leghari during a press briefing saying that the body will be divided into three separate entities by early next year to boost efficiency and cut costs in the nation's power grid. This restructuring, which has already been approved by the cabinet, is expected to improve oversight and eliminate longstanding issues like project delays, cost overruns, corruption and nepotism. It will create three independent entities — the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGCP), Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company (EIDMC), and Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO). NGCP will focus on making the country’s power transmission services more reliable and efficient. EIDMC will oversee development activities and manage energy infrastructure projects, while ISMO will establish a competitive electricity market, allowing consumers to choose from multiple suppliers, including distributors, to drive down costs. Each of these new entities will operate under separate boards of directors to promote accountability and reduce bureaucratic delays. Unlike the previous structure which employed thousands of staff, each new company will have between 50 and 70 employees. In addition to NTDC restructuring, the government is negotiating with private energy generators to reduce costs for consumers, with a focus on lowering power tariffs. Following this, the government plans to negotiate with its own generators including local renewable energy sources like wind and solar plants to lower costs and cut power tariffs. The minister highlighted Pakistan's growing prominence in green energy, noting that renewable sources including wind, solar, nuclear and hydro-power now account for 55% of the country’s energy mix. He said within the next decade, 88% of the nation’s energy production would come from clean sources. ""We are proud to be a leader in green energy in the region,"" said Leghari. He also underscored Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's recently announced Electricity Sahulat Package which will significantly reduce electricity prices by Rs26 per unit for consumers during the winter months —December 2024 to February 2025. The minister said the initiative was designed to encourage consumers to use electricity for heating instead of gas. If successful, the package could become an annual relief measure, providing lower prices during the winter months. ""Our goal is to make affordable electricity a consistent option for the public,"" he said, adding that the government remained committed to further reforming the energy sector, with the ultimate goal of transforming the country into the most efficient energy provider in the region. Leghari further highlighted recent improvements in power theft prevention and recovery, which contributed to better energy management. He encouraged consumers to take advantage of the new winter electricity package, emphasising that it would stimulate economic activity while supporting the country’s energy efficiency goals.","business"

CCP's report ""State of Competition in the Key Markets in Pakistan: Power Sector,"" says that the power sector's monopolistic grip, largely controlled by state enterprises, restricts private sector entry and drives up costs, leaving consumers with high bills and limited choices. Structural inefficiencies and a centralised single-buyer model exacerbate the problems, with power losses exceeding 17.6%, an ageing infrastructure, and soaring circular debt, it added. The report further highlights the significant presence and impact of SOEs on competition within the power sector, offering strategic insights for fostering a more competitive market environment. ""This report is a testament to the CCP's commitment to promoting fair competition and addressing market inefficiencies in every sector of the economy,"" said CCP Chairman Dr Kabir Ahmed Sidhu while emphasising the critical role of a competitive power sector in driving economic growth and ensuring affordable energy for consumers. Furthermore, the forum calls for change: to revitalise the sector through privatisation, investment in smart grids, and a shift to competitive pricing — before these entrenched flaws further erode economic stability and energy affordability for Pakistan. It reveals fundamental weaknesses in market dynamics, regulatory frameworks, and infrastructure quality that are impeding efficiency and affordability in the sector. Transmission and distribution are primarily controlled by the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) and regional distribution companies (Discos). A single-buyer model further restricts competition, with the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) acting as the sole purchaser of power producers. This centralised setup not only discourages private investment but also contributes to high operational inefficiencies, particularly in distribution where average losses exceed 17.6%. The sector’s installed capacity has grown, reaching 45,885 megawatts as of June 2023, with a diversified energy mix. Thermal sources account for 62.79% of this capacity, followed by hydel (23.18%), nuclear (7.89%), and renewables (6.14%). Furthermore, a competitive trading bilateral contract market (CTBCM) model was approved in 2020 to encourage private players, allowing bulk consumers to choose their power providers. Major weaknesses include high transmission and distribution losses, an ageing infrastructure, and circular debt that exacerbates inefficiency. The Paris Agreement, which Subsidies provided under the tariff differential subsidy (TDS) mechanism, while meant to stabilise prices, often benefits inefficient Discos disproportionately, undermining market equity. Additionally, unreasonable system charges deter new private entrants, hindering competitive pricing and sectoral reforms. Pakistan has significant potential to enhance competition by implementing the CTBCM model effectively. Encouraging private-sector participation, particularly through initiatives like competitive bidding for low-cost generation projects, could lower consumer prices and improve operational efficiency. Investment in smart grids and renewable energy, as seen in other countries, presents a sustainable path forward. Geographical and socio-economic challenges, including high costs associated with rural grid expansion and power losses due to long-distance transmission, create a complex operational environment. Resistance from entrenched SOEs and regulatory delays could stymie needed reforms. Without swift action, the sector’s inefficiencies could increasingly burden Pakistan’s economic growth and energy affordability. The report calls for sweeping reforms, including the phased privatisation or public-private partnerships (PPPs) for Discos to tackle distribution losses. It also recommends infrastructure investment, tariff rationalisation, and regulatory enhancements to support the CTBCM model’s implementation, setting the stage for broader retail competition. The CCP recommends swift implementation of the CTBCM model to open the wholesale electricity market, allowing bulk consumers more choice and fostering competition. Strengthening regulatory and market affairs within Discos is essential, alongside transparent charges for transmission and distribution services, the CCP also advises phasing out inefficient state-owned plants to cut costs. Competitive bidding should be used for low-cost generation projects, and the private sector’s participation in transmission expansion is crucial for efficiency. Transitioning Discos to public-private partnerships or privatising them will help reduce losses. Adjusting tariff subsidies to avoid uniform rates will promote efficiency, and gradually lowering the threshold for retail competition will boost consumer choice. Infrastructure upgrades for transmission and distribution are critical for competition, and consumer education on timely payments can improve financial stability and reduce theft. These steps aim to dismantle monopolies and create a more competitive, efficient power sector.","business"

""Saudi investments are growing. Agreements [between both nations] have now exceeded $6 billion. Al Baik is on its way to Pakistan, and Aramco has opened its first fuel station here,"" Tarar informed reporters in Lahore. Highlighting Pakistan’s improving global economic standing, the minister pointed out that numerous allied countries are now looking to expand their investments in the country.   He further disclosed that Qatar intends to invest $3 billion, while Azerbaijan has plans to contribute $2 billion. Additionally, Pakistan has recently signed a port development agreement with Abu Dhabi officials. ""Foreign reserves now stand at $11 billion, and remittances have reached $8 billion. This will open up significant job opportunities,"" Tarar noted, emphasising the positive impact of remittances on the national economy. He commended the contributions of Pakistanis abroad, remarking that their presence worldwide is boosting the country's foreign exchange through substantial remittances. In recent developments, Saudi Arabia’s Al Baik Food System Company signed a strategic memorandum of understanding with Pakistan’s Gas and Oil Pakistan Ltd (GO) to launch and operate its outlets across Pakistan, marking a critical milestone in the food chain's expansion strategy in the country. The signing ceremony was held with the support of Saudi Minister of Investment, Engineer Khalid Al-Falih, and attended by senior representatives from both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Founded in 1974 in Jeddah, AlBaik has gained widespread recognition for its signature broast chicken. With over 120 outlets across Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and other areas, the chain has built a loyal following, particularly among Pakistani expatriates and visitors to the Kingdom for business or religious reasons. GO, a major player in Pakistan’s oil and gas sector, is backed by a 40% stake from Saudi Aramco, positioning the company as a key partner in Al Baik’s launch across Pakistan.","business"

Talking to reporters in Islamabad, Aurangzeb said the country faced a trust and credibility gap in the eyes of the Fund because what was uttered and committed, was not implemented fully. His remarks come as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led government has begun preparations for high-stakes discussions with the lender next week amid the Federal Bureau of Revenue's (FBR) tax shortfall of Rs189 billion in the first four months of the current fiscal year. Confirming that the IMF team will be visiting Pakistan for stocktaking of the existing situation, the finance czar noted that the government fetched the desired revenues from retailers and wholesalers envisaged for the first quarter (July-September) period of the current fiscal year. The minister said the IMF endorsed the electricity winter package as nothing of this sort was done without the approval of the Fund. The structural benchmark and other quotative targets were signed but never fell through with the IMF, he maintained. Commenting on the privatisation process, Aurangzeb said: ""The government cannot run PIA so it will again try to privatise it. The button of privatisation will be switched on again"". Meanwhile, on the tax issue, it is yet to see how the IMF will respond to the government’s claim that the retailers and wholesalers deposited tax revenues of Rs10 billion during the first quarter but the retailers under Tajir Dost Scheme (TDS) paid just peanuts. In the budget for 2024-25, the FBR increased the tax liabilities for wholesalers and distributors under income tax obligation in case of selling products to non-filers and the rate was jacked up ten times. It forced wholesalers and retailers to pay an increased amount of Rs7 to Rs10 billion. Will the IMF accept it as tax payment under TDS is not yet known, said the sources. He said that all four provincial cabinets granted their nod for implementing Agri Income Tax and it would be in place from January 1, 2025, but collection would kick-start from next fiscal year. Additionally, the finance minister said that he did not buy the argument that the real estate resulted in boosting 40 industries. He said that the government would have to bring real estate, retailers and agriculture income into the tax net because the saturation point had already touched for getting maximum tax rates from salaried and manufacturers in the range of 45 to 50%. Can we further jack it up to 60%? The answer lies only in expanding the narrowed tax base and then rationalising tax rates for all others, he added. He said he had paid income tax as a salaried person which would be made public under the declaration of assets and income as parliamentarians.","business"
"171","China unveils sweeping local govt debt swap to lift ailing economy","https://www.geo.tv/latest/573413-china-unveils-14-trln-local-debt-package-but-no-direct-stimulus","BEIJING: China on Friday unveiled some of its most ambitious plans in years to lift local government debt and boost its economy, following a meeting of lawmakers eyeing the possibility of intensified trade tensions with US President-elect Donald Trump. Local governments in China face a ballooning debt burden of $5.6 trillion, according to Beijing, raising worries about wider economic stability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) put the figure at $8.4 trillion last year. Policymakers gathered in Beijing this week voted to swap their hidden debts — defined as borrowing for which a government is liable, but which is not disclosed to its citizens or to other creditors. The move would raise ""the local government debt limit by six trillion yuan, which will be used to replace existing hidden debts, freeing up space for local governments to better develop the economy and protect people's livelihood,"" state broadcasterCCTVsaid. The move was taken after ""fully considering the international and domestic development environment, ensuring the smooth operation of the economy and finance,"" Finance Minister Lan Fo'an told a press conference in Beijing. The debt ceiling will be raised every year from 2024 to 2026 ""to support local governments in replacing all kinds of hidden debt"", he said. A total of $558 billion of ""hidden debt can be replaced"", Lan explained. And $112 billion ""will be arranged from new local government special bonds every year for five consecutive years to supplement government financial resources"", he added. Lawmakers also approved a new energy law to promote ""carbon neutrality"" as Beijing moves ahead with its pledge to decarbonise its economy by 2060. Officials were this week keeping close tabs on the US vote as they gathered in the Chinese capital for a meeting of the country's top lawmaking body. Trump promised during his campaign of punishing tariffs on Chinese goods that threaten further grief for the world's second-largest economy, which is already grappling with a prolonged housing crisis and sluggish consumption. Observers say Beijing could seek to cushion that blow with a long-awaited ""bazooka stimulus"" for the economy — though caution details might still take time. This week's meeting, originally scheduled for late October, was likely pushed back to allow ""policymakers a chance to address a possible Trump win"", Chief Economist for Greater China at ING Lynn Song said. Beijing began to unveil a raft of measures in September aimed at boosting economic activity, including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions, but analysts have bemoaned the lack of detail so far.","business"
"172","Winter package: Rs26 per unit relief on extra consumption of power announced","https://www.geo.tv/latest/573420-winter-package-up-to-rs26-per-unit-relief-on-extra-consumption-of-power-announced","In an effort to manage seasonal electricity demand and stimulate economic growth, the government on Friday announced the ""Bijli Sahulat Package"" for the winter months from December 2024 to February 2025. According to a statement issued by the Power Division, a flat rate of Rs26.07 per unit will be offered for any additional electricity demand above the benchmark historical average. “Recognising that electricity demand in Pakistan peaks during summer and significantly decreases in winter, this initiative aims to encourage higher consumption during the low-demand winter season by offering reduced electricity rates.” This package will allow industries, commercial, general services and households to save significantly as compared to the prevailing tariffs. It further said that the government is committed to fostering increased industrial and commercial activity as a driver of economic growth. “Industries that consume additional electricity, beyond a set benchmark based on their historical consumption, will benefit from 18% to 37% discount on the prevailing tariff rate,” read the statement.   The Power Division said that this initiative encourages industries to increase production capacity while benefiting from lower average electricity costs, making their operations more cost-effective. Domestic consumers will also benefit from the discounted rate for additional winter electricity consumption, “making it an attractive option for heating and other energy needs that would otherwise rely on gas”. This initiative reflects the government’s commitment to innovative approaches that not only balance electricity demand across seasons but also provide economic advantages to consumers. Furthermore, all the incremental sales over and above 25% of the benchmark consumption would be charged normal tariffs as notified by the government, it added. Lauding the ""Bijli Sahulat Package"", Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the initiative would help domestic power consumers save significantly on excess consumption. He stated this while addressing a ceremony held in connection with the birth anniversary of Dr Allama Muhammad Iqbal Day —Poet of the East — in the federal capital.   Speaking on the occasion, the premier announced the three-month winter package, saying: “Industries’ wheel in the country will move swiftly due to the winter package.” Under the new package, a flat rate of Rs26.07 per unit would be offered to domestic consumers on extra consumption of electricity during the three-month period, the premier added. He said that the move will help the domestic consumers “save significantly”. He also thanked Power Minister Awais Leghari for the initiative. Highlighting his government’s achievements, PM Shehbaz said that they were taking the country forward in light of Iqbal’s message. “The country’s economic situation improving gradually.” Due to the government’s effective measures, inflation dropped to 6.7% as compared to 30% during the previous year. Interest rate has been slashed to 15%, the PM said, adding that that the rate was at 23% in 2022. He further said that the government was introducing reforms in each sector to put the country on the upward trajectory.","business"
"173","US Supreme Court rejects tobacco firms' appeal over graphic warnings","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576281-us-supreme-court-rejects-tobacco-firms-appeal-over-graphic-warnings","The US Supreme Court declined on Monday to decide whether federally mandated warnings on cigarette packs that graphically illustrate the health risks of smoking violate the free speech rights of tobacco companies opposed to the labels. The justices turned away an appeal by RJ Reynolds and other tobacco companies of a lower court's ruling that found that a set of health warnings required by the US Food and Drug Administration did not violate the rights of the companies under the US Constitution's First Amendment. The action by the justices means the lower court's ruling stands. The rule was adopted by the agency in 2020 during Donald Trump's first presidential administration. The FDA required that warnings about the risks of smoking occupy the top 50% of cigarette packs and top 20% of advertisements. The regulation is technically in effect, but the FDA has generally withheld enforcing it amid legal challenges. The set of 11 warnings include depictions of feet with amputated toes, a baby whose fetal growth had been stunted, and a woman with a large protrusion in her neck caused by cancer, along with written descriptions of various health risks. RJ Reynolds, which is part of British American Tobacco, ITG Brands, which is part of Imperial Brands, Liggett, which is part of Vector Group, and other tobacco companies sued in 2020 to challenge the warning labels. The companies claimed, among other things, that the health warnings violated their free speech rights by compelling the companies to endorse the US government's anti-smoking message through images they said misrepresented or exaggerated health consequences of smoking. US smoking rates have fallen dramatically in the past six decades, from 42.6% of American adults in 1965 to 11.6% in 2022, according to the American Lung Association. But, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking still causes more than 480,000 US deaths annually. The FDA said the warnings were justified by the US government's interest in promoting greater understanding of the health risks from smoking, and reducing confusion and deception. The agency argued that the illustrated warnings were necessary because text-only warnings failed to deter teenagers from smoking. US District Judge J Campbell Barker in Tyler, Texas, in 2022 blocked the regulation, finding that the graphic warnings violated First Amendment protections. But the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in March found that the disputed warnings were ""factual and uncontroversial,"" thus satisfying the relevant legal standard under the First Amendment. This prompted the tobacco companies to appeal to the Supreme Court. RJ Reynolds declined on Monday to comment on the court's decision to deny its appeal. In a separate case involving the FDA, the Supreme Court on December 2 is set to hear arguments over the agency's denial of applications to sell flavored vape products.","world"

Dominique Pelicot has been on trial in the southern city of Avignon since September with 49 other men for organising the rapes and sexual abuse of Gisele Pelicot, now his former wife. One man is being tried in absentia. The case has shocked France, which like other countries has seen a series of sexual abuse cases, and a prosecutor told the court that the trial needed to herald a fundamental change in relations between men and women. ""Twenty years is a lot because it is 20 years of a life,"" prosecutor Laure Chabaud said. ""But it is both a lot and too little. Too little in view of the seriousness of the acts that were committed and repeated."" Dominique has admitted all the charges linked to his plying Gisele with anti-anxiety drugs from 2011 to 2020, leaving her exposed to abuse by strangers recruited online. He documented the crimes in photos and videos discovered by police after being caught filming up women's skirts in public. ""It's a very emotional moment,"" said Gisele as she entered the courtroom. Prosecutors must also demand punishments for the other defendants: men aged 26 to 74 from all walks of life. ""This trial is shaking up our society in our relationship with each other, in the most intimate relationships between human beings,"" said Jean-Francois Mayet, the other prosecutor. French society has ""to understand our needs, our emotions, our desires and above all to take into account those of others,"" he said. What is at stake, he added, ""is not a conviction or an acquittal"" but ""to fundamentally change the relations between men and women"". Many accused argued in court that they believed Dominique's claim they were participating in a libertine fantasy, in which his then-wife had consented to sexual contact and was only pretending to be asleep. Among them, 33 have also claimed they were not in their right minds when they abused or raped Gisele — a defence not backed by any psychological report compiled by court-appointed experts. ""In 2024, we can no longer say 'since she said nothing, she agreed',"" said Chabaud. ""The absence of consent could not be ignored by the defendants."" Sentencing requests are slated to take three full days, with prosecutors estimating an average of 15 minutes per defendant. Most, including Dominique, are charged with aggravated rape. ""The facts, and the personality of each accused, were taken into account even in our sentencing demands"", Mayet said.","world"
"175","One woman killed by partner, relative every 10 minutes worldwide: UN","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576240-one-woman-killed-by-partner-relative-every-10-minutes-worldwide-un","VIENNA: One woman was killed by a partner or relative every 10 minutes worldwide in 2023, the United Nations warned Monday, stressing that femicides remained at ""alarmingly high levels"". Almost 85,000 women and girls were murdered by people last year, according to a joint report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the UN Women agency published Monday. About 60% — or more than 51,000 women and girls — died at the hands of their partner or relative, the report found. This equates to 140 women killed per day or one every 10 minutes by those closest to them. ""The home remains the most dangerous place for women and girls in terms of the risk of lethal victimisation,"" the report said. While men were four times more likely than women to fall victim to homicide — forming 80% of all murder victims last year — they more often than not died at the hands of a stranger. Africa had the most severe toll with 21,700 women killed by someone close to them in 2023. The lowest femicide rates were in Europe (2,300 murders in absolute numbers) and Asia. Despite efforts in some countries to prevent femicides, they remain ""at alarmingly high levels"" due to deep-rooted gender inequality and damaging stereotypes. ""We must confront and dismantle the gender biases, power imbalances, and harmful norms that perpetuate violence against women,"" UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly said in a statement accompanying the report. Data from countries including France indicated that femicides are often the ""culmination"" of repeated episodes of violence and can be prevented by measures such as restraining orders. UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said robust legislation, greater government accountability, and increased funding for women's rights organisations and institutional bodies are needed to stem violence against women. Furthermore, improved data collection from different national sources — including media reports — and a ""zero-tolerance culture"" are essential in tackling femicides, she said. The report is based on available data from 107 countries or territories, and information the UNODC has collected from responses submitted by member states. Its release coincides with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.","world"

According toTimes of India, the incident occurred on Saturday as two men, named Vivek and Amit, along with another passenger were en route from Gurugram to Bareilly for a wedding, while using Google Maps for directions. The navigation system directed them onto the incomplete flyover, leading to a 50-foot plunge into the shallow waters of the Ramganga River. The wreckage of the vehicle, as well as the three bodies, was discovered the following morning by locals who immediately alerted the police. The police sent the bodies for post-mortem examination after arriving at the scene. ""At 9:30am today, a damaged car was found on the river Ramganga. Police were informed and arrived at the spot,"" said a police officer. ""When the police arrived, they saw a [car], which was possibly hired as a taxi, on the river. The car went to the incomplete bridge and fell into a river from there,"" he stated. ""The bodies were found and taken for post-mortem. The identities of two people, Amit and Vivek, were confirmed. More details on the identity of the third one are being worked on,"" he added. The victims' families held the authorities responsible for the tragedy, questioning why the bridge was left incomplete and why no barricades were placed to block access to the structure. They demanded that a first information report (FIR) be filed against the construction department for negligence. ""The officials must be held accountable for this negligence. Why was the bridge left incomplete, and why were there no safety measures in place?” said a relative, demanding an investigation. The incident has raised serious concerns about the accuracy of digital maps and the potential risks associated with relying solely on technology for navigation.","world"
"177","India's parliament suspended over Adani bribery allegations","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576189-indias-parliament-suspended-over-adani-bribery-allegations","India's parliament was suspended on Monday after opposition lawmakers disrupted it demanding a discussion over bribery allegations against the Adani Group and Adani dollar bond prices fell to almost one-year lows as investors and lenders weighed the case. The Indian conglomerate's billionaire chairman, Gautam Adani, and seven other people were last week charged by US authorities with agreeing to pay around $265 million in bribes to Indian government officials. The charges related to alleged payments to obtain contracts that could yield $2 billion of profit over 20 years, as well as to develop India's largest solar power project. The charges also included making misleading statements to the public despite being made aware of the US investigation in 2023. The Adani Group has said the accusations as well as those levelled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in a parallel civil case are baseless and that it will seek ""all possible legal recourse"". Indian opposition parties, who have consistently targeted Adani for what they say is his proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had said last week that they would raise the issue in parliament when it meets on Monday. ""As the parliament session begins, the first step the government should take is to have a detailed discussion on the Adani saga which has the potential of tarnishing India’s image at the global stage,"" Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the main opposition Congress party, posted on X just as proceedings began in the upper house of parliament. This is the demand of the opposition alliance Congress leads, as the ""hard earned investments"" of tens of millions of retail investors are at stake, Kharge said. Jagdeep Dhankhar, the Vice President of India and the chairman of the upper house, said he had received 13 notices from lawmakers demanding a discussion on the Adani issue but he could not allow them as they did not conform to rules. Dhankhar asked Kharge to speak but was interrupted by lawmakers pressing their demand for a discussion, causing him to suspend the chambers briefly and later for the rest of the day. Similar scenes played out in the lower house a little later, forcing the speaker to suspend business for the day there as well. Indian opposition parties have in the past accused Modi's government of protecting and favouring Adani and his businesses, charges both deny. Modi’s opponents say he has longstanding ties with Adani, going back nearly two decades to when Modi was chief minister of the western state of Gujarat, to which Adani also belongs. They accuse the government of favouring the group in business deals, charges the government has rejected as ""wild allegations"". The government has not commented on the indictment but Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has said that it is for the Adani Group to deal with and defend itself and that the law will take its course. The disruption in parliament came as Adani dollar bond prices fell as investors cut their exposure to the conglomerate and some bankers considered pausing fresh lending in the wake of the indictment. Banks and regulators have been reviewing exposure to the ports-to-power conglomerate in the wake of the charges. The Singapore banking sector's overall exposure to the Adani Group, is small, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said on Monday. ""Banks have in place measures to review and manage their exposures to borrowers and counterparties,"" an MAS spokesperson said in a statement. DBS Group, Singapore's biggest bank by assets, had said in early 2023 that its exposure to the Adani Group was S$1.3 billion ($967 million). DBS declined comment in response to request from Reuters. Some global banks are considering temporarily halting fresh credit to the company after the US indictment but maintaining existing loans, according to several bankers spoken to by Reuters, raising questions about its access to future funding. ""In the near term, the US indictment is likely to constrain the group’s access to financing, particularly in the offshore market,"" a Lucror Analytics note published on Smartkarma said. Cash balances of Adani portfolio companies stood at $6.33 billion as of first half of the current fiscal year ending March 2025, the company said. The cash balances exceed long term debt repayments for the next 28 months, Adani said in a presentation on the credit and financial performance of its group companies, which it regularly shares after its quarterly results. The crisis is the second in two years to hit the Adani group, which was last year accused by short seller Hindenburg Research of improperly using offshore tax havens. The company denied those claims. In Asian trade on Monday, some of the most liquid debts, issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone fell between 1 cent and 2 cents, with similar selling in Adani Transmission debt. Ports bonds maturing in 2027 were down 1.6 cent to 88.98 cents on the dollar, having lost nearly 7 cents in face value since US prosecutors issued the charges last week. Longer-dated Ports bonds, were down on Monday and have lost between 8 cents and 10 cents in face value on the news. Adani Transmission debt maturing in May 2036 fell 1.8 cents on Monday for a loss of more than 7 cents since Wednesday. Adani group's 10 listed stocks led by Adani Enterprises lost $27.9 billion in market value over two sessions last week after the US charges. On Monday, most Adani-backed stocks pared gains from early trade, with Adani Energy Solutions reversing course to trade down about 2%. Eight of 10 Adani stocks were trading in the green at 0643 GMT.","world"
"178","Plastics: lifesaver turned environmental threat","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576162-plastics-lifesaver-turned-environmental-threat","PARIS: Before it threatened biodiversity, the oceans and the global food chain, plastics saved lives and transformed societies as a durable, malleable and cheap material. From the 1950s, plastics enjoyed a positive image ""in all areas of life"", according to the Plastic Atlas from the Heinrich Boell Foundation. But with plastic now an integral part of daily life and global production exploding, concerns abound about its impact on the health of the planet — and ourselves. Plastic is essential to the health industry, being used to manufacture items that have helped improve hygiene and boost life expectancy including single-use catheters, IV bags and syringes. Condoms, many of which are made from latex, have greatly improved public health and saved countless lives by protecting against sexually transmitted infections. Plastics are also widespread in packaging, helping perishable goods stay fresh and safe to consume while reducing overall food waste and illness from contamination. In more recent times, major studies have looked into the impact of microplastics on human health. Plastic particles ranging from 0.3 to 5 millimetres (0.01 to 0.20 inches) in length have been detected in human blood, breast milk and semen. Plastic has also been adapted for new medical uses, with electroactive polymers used in sensors to detect movement or heart rate. ""Plastic is becoming intelligent, attentive to people,"" said Mickael Pruvost, research engineer at the chemicals company Arkema, which develops these devices. Since appearing in the 19th century, plastic has undergone many reinventions. The first plastics were based on natural and renewable raw materials such as rubber, which was first discovered by the American Charles Goodyear. In 1869, celluloid arrived in the United States. This followed the invention of a plastic called Parkesine a few years before by an English chemist. Celluloid was first used industrially to replace ivory in billiard balls, and as film for cameras in the early days of cinema. Then, in 1884, French chemist Hilaire de Chardonnet patented the first artificial silk, which paved the way for the manufacture of nylon. The first entirely synthetic plastic — meaning free of any molecule found in nature — was invented in the United States in 1907 by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland. Known as Bakelite, it was the result of a reaction between phenol and formaldehyde and found use in the manufacturing of telephones, electrical outlets and ashtrays. Five years later, in 1912, German chemist Fritz Klatte patented polyvinyl chloride, better known as PVC. PVC really took off in the 1950s after the discovery that it could be manufactured cheaply from chlorine, a by-product of the chemical industry. Industrial production of other key plastics from refined petroleum also began around this time, notably in three flagship products. One was polyamide, which proved its worth in US parachutes during the June 1944 landing on the Normandy coast. Another to see action during World War II was polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE, a highly resistant product today better known as Teflon which forms the non-stick coating on cooking pans. Then there was silicone, still used today in products from swimming caps to hair gel. With the global population tripling to more than eight billion between 1950 and today, plastic production has multiplied 230 times over to satisfy demand. Some 60% of the plastic made today is used for packaging, construction and transportation, with other major uses in textiles and consumer goods at 10% each.

"179","Wildlife monitoring tech used to harass, spy on women in India","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576155-wildlife-monitoring-tech-used-to-harass-spy-on-women-in-india","PARIS: In a rather worrying development, it has come to light that technology intended to monitor wildlife has instead been used to harass and spy on women in India. Researchers have said that camera traps, drones and other technology aimed at keeping an eye on elephants and tigers were in fact being used to intimidate women. One particularly egregious example, a photo of an autistic woman relieving herself in the forest was shared by local men on social media, prompting villagers to destroy nearby camera traps. Trishant Simlai, a researcher at the UK's Cambridge University, spent 14 months interviewing some 270 people who live near the Corbett Tiger Reserve in northern India. For women living in villages around the reserve, the forest has long been a space for ""freedom and expression"" away from the men in a ""heavily conservative and patriarchal society"", Simlai toldAFP. The women sing, talk about taboo subjects and sometimes drink and smoke while collecting firewood and grass from the forest. But the introduction of camera traps, drones and sound recorders as part of efforts to track and protect tigers and other wildlife has extended ""the male gaze of the society into the forest"", said the researcher. On multiple occasions, drones were deliberately flown over the heads of women, forcing them to drop their firewood and flee for cover, according to a study led by Simlai published in the journal Environment and Planning. ""We cannot walk in front of the cameras or sit in the area with our Kurtis (tunics) above our knees. We are afraid that we might get photographed or recorded in a wrong way,"" a local woman was quoted in the study saying. In perhaps the most troubling example, a photo of an autistic woman from a marginalised caste relieving herself in the forest was inadvertently taken by a camera trap in 2017. Young men appointed as temporary forest workers shared the photo on local Whatsapp and Facebook groups to ""shame the woman"", said Simlai. ""We broke and set fire to every camera trap we could find after the daughter of our village was humiliated in such a brazen way,"" one local told the researchers. Aiming to avoid the cameras, some women have started roaming farther into the forest, which has the highest density of tigers in the world. The women also sing less than they used to, which was used to deter animal attacks. One local woman — who spoke about the fear of cameras forcing her into ""unfamiliar spaces"" in 2019 — was killed by a tiger earlier this year, remarked Simlai. However, contrastingly another woman took advantage of the constant surveillance. ""Whenever her husband would beat her, she would run in front of the camera so that her husband did not follow her,"" said Simlai. Overall, ""these technologies are actually very good"" and are revolutionising conservation efforts, he noted. Furthermore, he called for more consultation with local communities about the technology, as well as more transparency and oversight from forest authorities, and sensitive training for local workers. ""A lot of that can be done by conservation organisations that — in the first instance —introduced these technologies to the government,"" Simlai added. Rosaleen Duffy, a conservation expert at Sheffield University in the UK, toldAFPthat ""sadly"" she was not surprised by this research. ""What surprises me is conservationists who imagine that technologies can be introduced and used in a social, political and economic vacuum,"" she said. ""The cases in this research are not accidental,"" Duffy pointed out, adding: ""They were actively using the drones to provide new ways of continuing to harass women"". While this technology can be a powerful tool to conserve wildlife, ""there must be clear rules for what they can and cannot be used for, and clear consequences for anyone misusing them"", she added.","world"
"180","Court moves to sentencing in French mass rape trial","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576149-court-moves-to-sentencing-in-french-mass-rape-trial","  AIVGNON: Frech prosecutors are set to initiate their sentencing requests to judges on Monday over the evidence against a man who is under trial for allegedly drugging his wife for years so he could invite dozens of strangers to abuse her. Chief defendant Dominique Pelicot, since September, has been in the dock in the southern city of Avignon along with 49 other men for organising the rapes and sexual abuse of his now ex-wife Gisele Pelicot. The case has shocked a France still working through its version of the ""MeToo movement"", with the latest demonstrations calling for increased protection against sexual violence bringing out tens of thousands on the streets. Its impact has been relayed around the world, with 57 of the 138 media organisations covering the trial from outside France. On Thursday, the president of Chile's parliament hailed Gisele's ""courage and dignity"", calling her ""an ordinary citizen who has taught the whole world a lesson"". Beyond Dominique, who has admitted to all of the charges, prosecutors must decide on appropriate potential punishments for the other defendants which include men aged 26 to 74 from all walks of life. Many argued in court that they believed Dominique's claim they were participating in a libertine fantasy, in which his then-wife had consented to sexual contact and was only pretending to be asleep. Among them, 33 have also claimed they were not in their right minds when they abused or raped Gisele — a defence not backed up by any of the psychological reports compiled by court-appointed experts. Sentencing requests are slated to take three full days in the court's agenda, with prosecutors themselves estimating an average of 15 minutes per defendant. As 11 weeks of hearings about the facts of the case drew to a close last week, Gisele's lawyer Antoine Camus called for ""truth and justice"" to be rendered to the plaintiff as well as her three children, David, Caroline and Florian, her step-children Celine and Aurore, and her grandchildren. The court's five judges will not issue their ruling on the sentences until late December. The serious rape charges levelled at most of the accused carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. As the orchestrator of his ex-wife's abuse, Dominique appears likely to receive the full penalty. He has himself said he wants to go to prison for drugging Gisele with anti-anxiety drugs regularly from July 2011 to October 2020, leaving her vulnerable to abuse by strangers recruited online. Dominique documented the crimes extensively in photos and videos later discovered by police after he was caught filming up women's skirts in public. Prosecutors may also ask the maximum penalty for fellow defendant Jean-Pierre M, now aged 63, who applied Dominique's practices against his own wife to rape her a dozen times, sometimes in the presence of Dominique himself. Of the remaining accused, 35 completely deny taking part in a rape. Observers will be watching whether prosecutors ask for heavier penalties for those who came to rape Gisele multiple times — some of them as many as six — than for those who answered Dominique's invitation only once. After Dominique, two men accused of sexual assault and attempted rape will be dealt with first by prosecutors, before they move on to the defendants on trial for rape. Defence lawyers will have their turn to speak from Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, with Dominique's lawyer Beatrice Zavarro up first. Judges are expected to rule by December 20 at the latest on the sentencing.","world"
"181","Elon Musk becomes richest person ever","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576141-elon-musk-becomes-richest-person-ever","WASHINGTON: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reached a record-breaking personal wealth milestone, amassing a net worth of $348 billion,The Newsreported, citingBloomberg Billionaires Index. This achievement cements Musk’s position as the richest individual in history. The surge in his wealth follows a sharp increase in Tesla’s stock price, which gained momentum after Donald Trump’s electoral victory. The rally in Tesla shares was fuelled by Wall Street optimism over the pro-business policies expected under US President-elect Donald Trump, who is known to have close ties with the billionaire entrepreneur. Tesla’s stock has surged 40% since Election Day, climbing 3.8% on Friday alone to close at $352.56 — its highest price in over three years. This added $7 billion to Musk’s fortune, pushing his net worth past the previous high of $320.3 billion – set during Tesla’s pandemic-era surge in November 2021. Musk’s close ties with Trump have fuelled investor confidence. After endorsing Trump earlier this year, Musk donated over $100 million to his campaign. He has been appointed chair of the new “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), where he will work alongside biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Wall Street analysts view the incoming administration’s anticipated deregulation efforts as a significant advantage for Tesla, particularly for its Full Self-Driving initiatives, which have faced regulatory scrutiny. Beyond Tesla, Musk’s ventures in artificial intelligence and aerospace have further expanded his wealth. His 60% stake in xAI, a private AI firm valued at $50 billion, added $13 billion to his fortune. Meanwhile, his 42% stake in SpaceX, valued at $210 billion in a June tender offer, contributed $88 billion. Speculation around SpaceX’s upcoming funding round, which could value the company at $250 billion, suggests Musk’s net worth might climb even higher, potentially adding $18 billion to his fortune. Musk’s current net worth puts him $80 billion ahead of Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman, who holds the title of the world’s second-richest individual with $235 billion. Most of Musk’s wealth stems from his 13% stake in Tesla, currently valued at $145 billion and his pending 9% equity award in the company. However, despite his historic fortune, Tesla shares remain about 14% below their all-time high from late 2021. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 index has risen 27% since then.","world"
"182","Left-wing Yamandu Orsi projected to win Uruguay polls","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576137-left-wing-candidate-orsi-is-projected-to-win-the-uruguay-election","Left-wing candidate Yamandu Orsi was projected to win  Uruguay's presidential election, media reported Sunday, in a rebuke by voters of five years of conservative rule. Uruguayans went to the polls for the second round of voting in what became a tight race between Orsi, of the Frente Amplio (Broad Front) alliance, and Alvaro Delgado of the National Party, a member of outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou´s centre-right Republican Coalition. Orsi received 49 percent of the vote to Delgado's 46.6 percent, according to an Equipos Consultores poll carried by TV station Canal 10, while the leftist politician was projected to have 49.5 percent of the vote against 45.9 percent for his opponent in a Cifra poll cited by Canal 12. Orsi's campaign was boosted by support from Jose ""Pepe"" Mujica, a former guerrilla lionized as ""the world's poorest president"" because of his modest lifestyle during his 2010-2015 time in office. Orsi, seen as an understudy of  Mujica, had garnered 43.9 percent of the October 27 first-round vote — short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff but ahead of the 26.7  percent of ballots cast for Delgado. The pair came out on top of a crowded field of 11 candidates seeking to replace Lacalle Pou, who has a high approval rating but is barred constitutionally from seeking a second consecutive term. Polls had pointed to a narrow race Sunday,  with Orsi only marginally ahead in stated voter intention in South  America's second-smallest country. Polls closed at 7:30 pm (2230 GMT). Mujica, who is battling cancer and had to use a cane to walk into his polling station to vote, said Sunday: ""I have nothing more to look forward to. My closest future is the cemetery, for reasons of age. ""But I am interested in the fate of you, the young people who, when they are my age, will live in a very different world."" A smiling Orsi cast his ballot Sunday in the rural Canelones region, to applause from supporters. Delgado shook hands with polling station officials as he cast his vote in Montevideo. ""If I win, tomorrow I plan to invite candidate Orsi to come to have some mate,"" Delgado said, referring to a traditional herbal infusion  Uruguayans sip frequently. Other parties within the Republican  Coalition had thrown their support behind Delgado since the first round, boosting his numbers. A victory for Orsi will see Uruguay swing left again after five years of centre-right rule in the country of 3.4  million inhabitants. The Frente Amplio coalition broke a decades-long conservative stranglehold with an election victory in 2005 and held the presidency for three straight terms. It was voted out in 2020 on the back of concerns about rising crime blamed on high taxes and a surge in cocaine trafficking through the port of Montevideo. Polling numbers ahead of the vote showed that perceived insecurity remains Uruguayans' top concern five years later. A 72-year-old retiree who voted, Juan Antonio Stivan, said he just wanted the next government to guarantee ""safety — to be able to go out in the street with peace of mind, as an old person, as a young person, as a  child."" Another voter, Aldo Soroara, a 60-year-old winegrower, said he expected whoever is elected as president to do ""the best he can for  the people,"" adding: ""You can't ask for much more in these difficult  times."" Voting is compulsory in Uruguay, one of Latin America's most stable democracies, with comparatively high per-capita income and low poverty levels. During the heyday of leftist rule, Uruguay legalized abortion and same-sex marriage, became the first Latin American country to ban smoking in public places and the world's first nation, in 2013,  to allow recreational cannabis use.","world"
"183","COP29: $300b climate deal termed 'insufficient' by developing nations","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576121-cop29-300b-climate-deal-termed-insufficient-by-developing-nations","Countries at the COP29 summit in Baku agreed on a $300 billion annual global finance target on Sunday to assist poorer nations in addressing the effects of climate change. However, the intended beneficiaries criticised the deal as grossly inadequate. The agreement, finalised after extended negotiations at the two-week conference in Azerbaijan's capital, aimed to bolster global efforts to combat climate change in what is set to become the hottest year on record. While some delegates responded with a standing ovation in the plenary hall, others condemned wealthy nations for their perceived lack of commitment and criticised Azerbaijan's leadership for rushing the controversial plan to approval. ""I regret to say that this document is nothing more than an optical illusion,"" Indian delegation representative Chandni Raina told the closing session of the summit, minutes after the deal was gavelled in. ""This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Therefore, we oppose the adoption of this document."" United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell acknowledged the difficult negotiations that led to the agreement but hailed the outcome as an insurance policy for humanity against global warming. ""It has been a difficult journey, but we've delivered a deal,"" Stiell said. ""This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives. ""But like any insurance policy, it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time."" The agreement would provide $300 billion annually by 2035, boosting rich countries' previous commitment to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020. That earlier goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. The deal also lays the groundwork for next year's climate summit, to be held in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, where countries are meant to map out the next decade of climate action. The summit cut to the heart of the debate over the financial responsibility of industrialised countries - whose historic use of fossil fuels has caused the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions - to compensate others for worsening damage from climate change. It also laid bare divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from the costs of storms, floods and droughts. Negotiations had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as representatives from nearly 200 countries struggled to reach consensus. Talks were interrupted on Saturday as some developing countries and island nations walked away in frustration. ""We are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need. It isn’t nearly enough, but it’s a start,"" said Tina Stege, Marshall Islands climate envoy. Nations have been seeking financing to deliver on the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels - beyond which catastrophic climate impacts could occur. The world is currently on track for as much as 3.1 C (5.6 F) of warming by the end of this century, according to the 2024 UN Emissions Gap report, with global greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel use continuing to rise. Sunday's deal failed to set out detailed steps for how countries will act on last year's UN climate summit pledge to transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewable energy capacity this decade. Some negotiators said Saudi Arabia had attempted to block such a plan during the talks. ""There's a challenge in getting greater ambition when you're negotiating with the Saudis,"" said US climate adviser John Podesta. A Saudi official did not immediately provide comment. The roster of countries required to contribute - about two dozen industrialised countries, including the US, European nations and Canada - dates back to a list decided during UN climate talks in 1992. European governments have demanded others pay in, including China, the world's second-biggest economy, and oil-rich Gulf states. The deal encourages developing countries to make contributions but does not require them. The agreement includes a broader goal of raising $1.3 trillion in climate finance annually by 2035 - which would include funding from all public and private sources and which economists say matches the sum needed to address global warming. Countries also agreed on rules for a global market to buy and sell carbon credits that proponents say could mobilise billions more dollars into new projects to fight global warming, from reforestation to deployment of clean energy technologies. Securing the climate finance deal was a challenge from the start. Donald Trump's US presidential election victory this month has raised doubts among some negotiators that the world's largest economy would pay into any climate finance goal agreed in Baku. Trump, a Republican who takes office in January, has called climate change a hoax and promised to again remove the US from international climate cooperation. President Joe Biden congratulated the COP29 participants for reaching what he called a historic agreement that would help mobilise needed funds but said more work was needed. ""While there is still substantial work ahead of us to achieve our climate goals, today’s outcome puts us one significant step closer. On behalf of the American people and future generations, we must continue to accelerate our work to keep a cleaner, safer, healthier planet within our grasp,"" Biden said in a statement. Western governments have seen global warming slip down the list of national priorities amid surging geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s war in Ukraine expanding conflict in the Middle East, and rising inflation. The showdown over financing for developing countries comes in a year scientists predict will be the hottest on record. Climate woes are stacking up, with widespread flooding killing thousands across Africa, deadly landslides burying villages in Asia, and drought in South America shrinking rivers. Developed countries have not been spared. Torrential rain triggered floods in Valencia, Spain, last month that left more than 200 dead, and the US so far this year has registered 24 billion-dollar disasters — just four fewer than last year.","world"

""I'll be able to do some everyday tasks with this artificial hand,"" said student Hafeez Mohammad Hossain, 19, whose right hand was ripped off in gunfire on August 5. It was the same day protesters stormed Hasinas palace as she fled to India by helicopter. In the middle of the chaos, Hossain said a police officer levelled a shotgun at him and fired. He described searing pain as gun pellets lacerated his back and leg. Surgeons picked out the gunshot, but were unable to save his hand. ""I can't write anymore,"" Hossain said. ""I'm struggling to learn how to write with my left hand."" On Thursday, he was fitted with a prosthetic limb, alongside four other students who also lost their hands during the months-long protests in which at least 700 people were killed during a police crackdown. Robolife Technologies, a Bangladeshi organisation manufacturing artificial hands, said the prosthetic limbs use sensors connected to the nerves to move. The company says it allows users to grasp objects, to type and use a phone. ""If you ask me whether they work like organic hands, I'd say no,"" said Antu Karim, who is working on the government-backed project to fit the limbs. ""But these hands allow the boys to hold a glass if thirsty, or a spoon to eat,"" he added. ""At least, they won't be looked down upon for not having hands."" Hasina's 15-year tenure saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents. Limbless protesters held a rally earlier this month demanding the interim government who took over after Hasina's fall support those injured in the protests. Many say they have not received the aid they need. The four other former protesters who had arms fitted on Thursday included Mohammad Mamun Mia, 32, a father of two, whose hand was hacked off by a gang he said was loyal to Hasina's Awami League party. The new arm is far from perfect, but it has made a huge difference. ""I'll be able to do some regular tasks with this hand,"" he said, saying that while he cannot work driving a tractor in the fields again, he hopes now to open a small business. Arif Hossain Sagar, 19, had his hand amputated after it failed to heal from an injury he sustained during the protests, and doctors worried about gangrene. ""I can't do any regular activities now,"" Sagar toldAFP. ""I rely on others for eating or bathing."" The new hand will return a degree of normality to his life, he said. Nayeem Hasan, wounded when attackers pounced on him as he went to donate blood to help those injured after a fire, broke into tears. The new arm would help him fulfil his simple dream. ""I have a one-year-old daughter who wants me to hold her,"" Hasan said.","world"

In a dramatic sign of a widening rift between the two most powerful political families in the Southeast Asian nation, Duterte told an early morning press conference that she had spoken to an assassin and instructed him to kill Marcos, his wife and the speaker of the Philippine House if she were to be killed. ""I have talked to a person. I said, if I get killed, go kill BBM (Marcos), (first lady) Liza Araneta, and (Speaker) Martin Romualdez. No joke. No joke,"" Duterte said in the profanity-laden briefing. ""I said, do not stop until you kill them and then he said yes,"" she said. She was responding to an online commenter urging her to stay safe, saying she was in enemy territory as she was at the lower chamber of Congress overnight with her chief of staff. Duterte did not cite any alleged threat against herself. The Presidential Communications Office responded with a statement saying: ""Acting on the Vice President's clear and unequivocal statement that she had contracted an assassin to kill the president if an alleged plot against her succeeds, the Executive Secretary has referred this active threat to the Presidential Security Command for immediate proper action. ""Any threat to the life of the president must always be taken seriously, more so that this threat has been publicly revealed in clear and certain terms,"" it said. Duterte's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the presidential office's statement. ""This country is going to hell because we are led by a person who doesn't know how to be a president and who is a liar,"" she said in the briefing. Duterte, the daughter of Marcos' predecessor, resigned from the cabinet in June while remaining vice president, signalling the collapse of a formidable political alliance that helped her and Marcos, son and namesake of the late authoritarian leader, secure their 2022 electoral victories by wide margins. Duterte's outburst is the latest in a series of startling signs of the feud at the top of Philippine politics. In October, she accused Marcos of incompetence and said she had imagined cutting the president's head off. The two families are at odds over foreign policy and former president Rodrigo Duterte's deadly war on drugs, among others. Past political violence in the Philippines has included the assassination of Benigno Aquino, a senator who staunchly opposed the rule the elder Marcos, as he exited his plane upon arrival home from political exile in 1983.","world"

Iran reacted to the resolution — proposed by Britain, France, Germany and the United States — with what government officials called various measures such as activating numerous new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium. Japan'sKyodonews agency, which first reported that the meeting would take place on Friday in Geneva, said Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's government was seeking a solution to the nuclear impasse ahead of the inauguration in January of US President-elect Donald Trump. A senior Iranian official confirmed that the meeting would go ahead next Friday, adding: ""Tehran has always believed that the nuclear issue should be resolved through diplomacy. Iran has never left the talks."" Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei later said the deputy foreign ministers of Iran, France, Germany and Britain would take part in the talks, which he said would cover regional issues as well as the nuclear dossier. Baghaei did not say where the talks would take place. A spokesperson for the Swiss foreign ministry directed questions to the countries named in the Kyodo report. ""Views will be exchanged ... on a range of regional discussions and subjects including the issues of Palestine, Lebanon and also the nuclear subject"", Baghaei said. In 2018, the then-Trump administration exited Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six major powers and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to violate the pact's nuclear limits, with moves such as rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output. Indirect talks between President Joe Biden's administration and Tehran to try to revive the pact have failed, but Trump said during his election campaign in September: ""We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible.

""Two persons were confirmed dead,"" Pawan Kumar, a police officer in Sambhal in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, toldAFP, adding that 16 police officers were ""seriously injured"" during the clashes. ThePress Trust of Indianews agency quoted officials saying three people had died. Hindu activist groups have laid claim to several mosques they say were built over Hindu temples during the Muslim Mughal empire centuries ago. Street battles broke out when a team of surveyors entered the Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal on orders from a local court, after a petition from a Hindu priest claiming it was built on the site of a Hindu temple. Protesters on Sunday hurled rocks at police, who fired tear gas canisters to clear the crowd. Hindu nationalist activists were emboldened earlier this year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a grand new Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya, built on grounds once home to the centuries-old Babri mosque. That mosque was torn down in 1992 in a campaign spearheaded by members of Modi's party, sparking sectarian riots that killed 2,000 people nationwide, most of them Muslims. Some Hindu campaigners see an ideological patron in Modi. Calls for India to more closely align the country's officially secular political system with its majority Hindu faith have rapidly grown louder since Modi was swept to office in 2014, making the country's roughly 210-million-strong Muslim minority increasingly anxious about their future.","world"

Hampshire Police in southern England said a man died after a tree fell onto a car on a major road near Winchester while authorities in West Yorkshire said that they were investigating a potential link between a second death in a traffic accident and the storm. However, the road involved was not icy at the time. In Ireland, Storm Bert left over 60,000 properties without power, while also disrupting ferry and train routes across the Irish Sea. Major transport hubs in Britain faced significant delays, with airports and Channel ports severely impacted. Meanwhile, in France, tens of thousands remained without electricity following Storm Caetano earlier in the week, leading to hundreds of passengers being stranded as train services were halted due to power outages. Media footage showed flooding in the west of Ireland, which also caused rail closures in Northern Ireland. Snow impacted travel across Britain. The heaviest snow hit Scotland and parts of northern and central England, with dozens of flood alerts in place. The United Kingdom's Met Office issued snow and ice warnings for those regions, saying there was a ""good chance some rural communities could be cut off"". Scottish hills could see up to 40 centimetres of snow, while winds approaching 113 kilometres per hour were recorded in Britain. Ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday, with sailings from Newhaven and Dover in southern England to Dieppe and Calais in France severely affected. Flights were disrupted at Newcastle airport due to heavy snow, with some flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh. In Britain, the National Grid operator said power had been restored to ""many homes and businesses"" but more than 4,000 properties across the country were still without electricity on Saturday — the majority in southwest England. Some 47,000 homes remained without power in northern France on Saturday, two days after the country was battered by Storm Caetano, power company Enedis said. Up to 270,000 people had been cut off due to the storm but Enedis said it had 2,000 technicians working to reconnect electricity lines torn down by winds of up to 130kph. Several hundred passengers were stranded on two trains in western France halted by power cuts. Some 200 people on a train going from Hendaye to Bordeaux and 400 on high-speed TGV going from Hendaye to Paris spent up to nine hours in the carriages.

""As our next Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke will spearhead the effort to protect American Farmers, who are truly the backbone of our Country,"" Trump said in a statement. If confirmed by the Senate, Rollins would lead a 100,000-person agency with offices in every county in the country, whose remit includes farm and nutrition programs, forestry, home and farm lending, food safety, rural development, agricultural research, trade and more. It had a budget of $437.2 billion in 2024. The nominee's agenda would carry implications for American diets and wallets, both urban and rural. Department of Agriculture officials and staff negotiate trade deals, guide dietary recommendations, inspect meat, fight wildfires and support rural broadband, among other activities. ""Brooke’s commitment to support the American Farmer, defense of American Food Self-Sufficiency, and the restoration of Agriculture-dependent American Small Towns is second to none,"" Trump said in the statement. The America First Policy Institute is a right-leaning think tank whose personnel have worked closely with Trump's campaign to help shape policy for his incoming administration. She chaired the Domestic Policy Council during Trump's first term. As agriculture secretary, Rollins would advise the administration on how and whether to implement clean fuel tax credits for biofuels at a time when the sector is hoping to grow through the production of sustainable aviation fuel. The nominee would also guide next year's renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal, in the shadow of disputes over Mexico's attempt to bar imports of genetically modified corn and Canada's dairy import quotas. Trump has said he again plans to institute sweeping tariffs that are likely to affect the farm sector. He was considering offering the role to former US Senator Kelly Loeffler, a staunch ally whom he chose to co-chair his inaugural committee, CNN reported on Friday.","world"
"191","Rich nations raise cash offer to poor countries in climate talks","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575951-rich-nations-raise-cash-offer-to-poor-nations-in-climate-talks","Wealthy nations raised their offer for climate finance for poorer nations to $300 billion Saturday at COP29 negotiations, with growing doubts that all countries will leave happy with the outcome. Negotiators worked through the night in a sports stadium in the Caspian Sea city of Baku in a search for compromise as the two-week COP29 conference dragged into an extra day. In a year set to be the hottest ever recorded, developing nations bearing the brunt of rising drought and disasters flatly rejected Friday an initial offer of $250 billion per year by 2035. On Saturday, wealthy countries — whose ranks include the European Union, the United States, Britain and Japan — raised the sum to $300 billion, said multiple sources with close knowledge of the negotiations. The revised offer from rich countries came with conditions in other parts of the broader climate deal under discussion in Azerbaijan. The EU in particular wants an annual review of global efforts to phase out fossil fuels, which are the main drivers of global warming. This has run into opposition from Saudi Arabia, which has sought to water down a landmark pledge to transition away from oil, gas and coal made at COP28 last year. ""We will not allow the most vulnerable, especially the small island states, to be ripped off by the new, few rich fossil fuel emitters,"" said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. Irish climate minister Eamon Ryan said he was ""hopeful"" for a deal but that a clearer picture would emerge later in the day, when a new text is expected. Ryan toldAFPdeveloping countries needed money ""but also we have to put a halt to the advance of fossil fuels."" A coalition of more than 300 activist groups accused historic polluters most responsible for climate change of skirting their obligation, and urged developing nations to stand firm. ""You claim to champion a rules-based system, yet flout the rules when they don't suit your interests, putting at risk billions of people and life on Earth,"" the non-governmental organisations wrote in an open letter. Wealthy nations counter that it is politically unrealistic to expect more in direct government funding. The US earlier this month elected former president Donald Trump, a sceptic of both climate change and foreign assistance, and a number of other Western countries have seen right-wing backlashes against the green agenda. The draft deal posits a larger overall target of $1.3 trillion per year to cope with rising temperatures and disasters, but most would come from private sources. Even $250 billion would be a step up from the $100 billion now provided by wealthy nations under a commitment set to expire. A group of developing countries had demanded at least $500 billion, with some saying that increases were less than met the eye due to inflation. Experts commissioned by the United Nations to assess the needs of developing countries said $250 billion was ""too low"" and by 2035 rich nations should be providing at least $390 billion. This figure was taken up by Brazil, the host of next year's COP30, which says $390 billion should be the sole responsibility of wealthier countries. The US and EU have wanted newly wealthy emerging economies like China — the world's largest emitter — to chip in. China, which remains classified as a developing nation under the UN framework, provides climate assistance but wants to keep doing so on its own voluntary terms. While China has generally taken a low-key and cooperative stance in Baku, oil-rich Saudi Arabia has pushed hard for weaker language on fossil fuels and, like China, has fought against being obliged to provide aid, one veteran activist from a developing country said. Azerbaijan, an authoritarian state that relies on oil and gas exports, has been accused of lacking the experience and bandwidth to steer such complex negotiations. Its leader Ilham Aliyev opened the conference by railing against Western nations and hailing fossil fuels as a ""gift of God"".","world"

Singh said that ""shortly before the pyre was to be lit, Rohitash's body started movements"", adding that ""he was alive and was breathing"". Kumar was rushed to hospital for a second time, but was confirmed dead on Friday during treatment.

In Maharashtra, home to India's financial capital Mumbai, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Mahayuti alliance was leading in 221 of 288 seats. The opposition Congress party and its allies are leading in 55 seats in the state elections, local media reported. ""The Mahayuti government [...] has achieved undisputed and resounding success,"" Eknath Shinde, the state's chief minister, said on social media platform X. Modi lost his majority in parliamentary elections held between April and June and had to depend on fickle allies to form a government. Last month his party won state elections in the northern state of Haryana. State election wins help political parties boost their numbers in the upper house of parliament, which is key for decision-making. In the mine-rich eastern Jharkhand state, the ruling regional party Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, which is in alliance with the Congress-led opposition, is leading to regain control by defeating the BJP and its allies, media reported. Political parties in both states have rolled out a range of measures that they say will benefit farmers and women, both considered critical voting blocks.

"195","Trump taps Scott Bessent for Treasury, capping long drama over choice","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575861-trump-taps-scott-bessent-for-treasury-capping-long-drama-over-choice","President-elect Donald Trump on Friday said he will nominate prominent investor Scott Bessent as US Treasury secretary, ending days of twists that saw high profile candidates pitted against each other for the cabinet position with vast influence over economic, regulatory and international affairs. Wall Street has been closely watching who Trump would choose, especially given his plans to remake global trade through tariffs and extend and potentially expand the raft of tax cuts enacted during his first term. The choice of Bessent, 62, who has spent his career in finance, gives Wall Street an advocate for tax reform and deregulation. Some strategists said his nomination was a relief as he understands markets and his appointment could reduce the chance of severe tariffs. The announcement — the most prominent of a flurry of Friday night appointments by Trump — caps a week where big name Wall Street luminaries' chance at the job oscillated on a daily basis. Other names that had been considered included Apollo Global Management Chief Executive Marc Rowan and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh. Investor John Paulson had also been a leading candidate, but dropped out, while Wall Street veteran Howard Lutnick, another contender, was appointed as head of the Commerce Department. The choice came after days of deliberations by Trump as he sorted through a shifting list of candidates. Bessent spent day after day at Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida providing economic advice, sources said, a proximity to the president-elect that may have helped him prevail. ""Scott is widely respected as one of the world's foremost international investors and geopolitical and economic strategists,"" said Trump as he announced the nomination in a statement released on Truth Social. Bessent, from South Carolina, has spent his career in finance, working for macro investment billionaire George Soros and noted short seller Jim Chanos, as well as running his own hedge fund. As a money manager, he made a large bet on Trump winning after spotting what he called an anomaly in the market — that political and market analysts were too negative on what a Trump victory would mean. Bessent, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has advocated for tax reform and deregulation, particularly to spur more bank lending and energy production, as noted in a recent opinion piece he wrote forthe Wall StreetJournal. The market's surge after Trump's election victory, he wrote, signaled investor expectations of ""higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans."" ""Bessent has been on the side of less aggressive tariffs,"" said Oxford Economics' Ryan Sweet, adding that picking him makes the steep tariffs Trump proposed on the campaign trail less likely. Bessent follows other financial luminaries who have taken the job, including former Goldman Sachs executives Robert Rubin, Hank Paulson and Steven Mnuchin, Trump's first Treasury chief. Janet Yellen, the current secretary and first woman in the job, previously chaired the Federal Reserve and White House Council of Economic Advisers. As Treasury secretary, Bessent will essentially be the highest-ranking US economic official, responsible for maintaining the plumbing of the world's largest economy, from collecting taxes and paying the nation's bills to managing the $28.6-trillion Treasury debt market and overseeing financial regulation, including handling and preventing market crises. The Treasury boss also runs US financial sanctions policy, has influence over the US-led International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other international financial institutions, and manages national security screenings of foreign investments in the United States. Bessent will face challenges, including safely managing federal deficits that are forecast to grow by nearly $8 trillion over a decade due to Trump's plans to extend expiring tax cuts next year and add generous new breaks, including ending taxes on Social Security income. Without offsetting revenues, this new debt would add to an unsustainable fiscal trajectory already forecast to balloon US debt by $22 trillion through 2033. Managing debt increases this large without market indigestion will be a challenge, though Bessent has argued Trump's agenda will unleash stronger economic growth that will grow revenue and shore up market confidence, opens new tab. Bessent will also inherit the role carved out by Yellen to lead the Group of Seven wealthy democracies in providing tens of billions of dollars in economic support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion and tightening sanctions on Moscow. But it is unclear whether he will pursue this, given Trump's desire to end the war quickly and withdraw US financial support for Ukraine. Another area where Bessent will likely differ from Yellen is her focus on climate change, from her mandate that development banks expand lending for clean energy to incorporating climate risks into financial regulations and managing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean-energy tax credits. Trump, a climate-change skeptic, has vowed to increase production of US fossil fuel energy and end the clean-energy subsidies in President Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The Treasury secretary is also the administration's closest point of contact with the Federal Reserve. Both Yellen under Biden and Mnuchin under Trump typically met weekly with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, often over breakfast or lunch. Bessent has floated the idea of creating a ""shadow"" Fed chair. This would entail nominating as early as possible a presumptive Powell successor to the Fed Board who would then deliver their own policy guidance so that, as Bessent told Barron's last month, ""no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore."" Bessent has since said he no longer thinks the idea of a shadow chair is worth pursuing, theWall Street Journalreported. Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May 2026. Bessent, along with John Paulson, had been an early favorite for job earlier in the year according to a Reuters report at the time and seemed to be in pole position a week after election day, on Nov. 12, when Paulson exited the race citing ""complex financial obligations"". However, there were many twists in the race for the top position. On November 13, banker Howard Lutnick, who was leading a transition team to vet personnel and draft policy, emerged as a top contender. Lutnick, however, was taken out of the running after Trump nominated him to lead his trade and tariff strategy as head of the Commerce Department. The pool of candidates then widened when Rowan, and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh were under consideration as well as Republican US Senator Bill Hagerty, sources with knowledge of the transition process said at the time.","world"

""Dr Nesheiwat is a fierce advocate and strong communicator for preventive medicine and public health,"" Trump said in a statement. ""She is committed to ensuring that Americans have access to affordable, quality healthcare, and believes in empowering individuals to take charge of their health to live longer, healthier lives."" She treated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, tended to victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Joplin tornadoes, and has worked for the Samaritan's Purse disaster relief organization providing care in Morocco, Haiti and Poland, Trump said. Many Americans will know her as a Fox News contributor who has discussed issues such as the mpox strain, the effects of alcohol and drug use, or natural disaster relief. Trump has plucked a number of presidential appointments from Fox News programs, both in his first term from 2017-2021 and since being elected again on Nov. 5. Communication skills are important to the job's role as health educator, providing information on how to improve health and lower the risk of illness. The job title became part of American culture in 1965 when cigarette makers were required to label packages with the surgeon general's warning that smoking was hazardous to health. Former Surgeon General C.

"198","Trump may seek dismissal of hush money case as sentencing delayed","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575803-trump-may-seek-dismissal-of-hush-money-case-sentencing-delayed","NEW YORK: Donald Trump may seek dismissal of the criminal case in which he was convicted in May of 34 felony counts involving hush money paid to an adult film actress, a judge ruled on Friday, while also indefinitely delaying Trump's sentencing in light of his victory in the November 5 US presidential election. The sentencing had been scheduled to take place next Tuesday. Prosecutors with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office this week asked New York state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan to consider deferring all proceedings in the case until after Trump, 78, finishes his four-year presidential term that begins on January 20, 2025. Lawyers for Trump, a Republican, have argued that the case must be dismissed because having it loom over him while he is president would cause ""unconstitutional impediments"" to his ability to govern. Bragg's office said it would argue against dismissal, but agreed that Trump deserves time to make his case through written motions. Merchan on Friday set a December 2 deadline for Trump to file his motion to dismiss and gave prosecutors until December 9 to respond. The judge did not set a new date for sentencing or indicate how long proceedings would remain on hold. The judge also did not indicate when he would rule on Trump's motion to dismiss. The case stemmed from a $130,000 payment Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to an adult film actress for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she has said she had a decade earlier with Trump, who denies it. A Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to cover up his reimbursement of Cohen. It was the first time a US president — former or sitting — had been convicted of or charged with a criminal offence. Trump pleaded not guilty in the case, which he has sought to portray as a politically motivated attempt by Bragg, a Democrat, to interfere with his presidential campaign. ""The American People have issued a mandate to return him to office and dispose of all remnants of the Witch Hunt cases,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. A spokesperson for Bragg's office declined to comment. Falsification of business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Before he was elected, experts said it was unlikely — but not impossible — that Trump would face time behind bars, with punishments such as a fine or probation seen as more likely. Trump's victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov 5 election made the prospect of imposing a sentence of jail or probation even more politically fraught and impractical, given that a sentence could have impeded his ability to conduct the duties of the presidency. He was charged in three additional state and federal cases in 2023, one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. He pleaded not guilty in all three cases. A Florida-based federal judge in July dismissed the documents case. The Justice Department is now evaluating how to wind down the federal election-related case. Trump also faces state criminal charges in Georgia over his bid to reverse his 2020 loss in that state, but that case remains in limbo. As president, Trump would have no power to shut down the New York or Georgia cases because they were filed in state courts. His Justice Department may close the federal cases. Trump last week nominated his defence lawyers in the hush money case, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, to serve senior roles at the Justice Department during his administration.","world"

Motorbike-riding thieves arrived at the Hieron museum in Paray-le-Monial in central France at around 4pm (1500 GMT) on Thursday. Three entered the building and one stood guard outside, mayor Jean-Marc Nesme said. The group fired several shots before heading for the museum's star exhibit, a 3m (10ft) work executed in 1904 depicting the life of Christ in precious metals, jewels and ivory. Known as ""Via Vitae"", it is classed as a national treasure by France's culture ministry, with an estimated value of up to seven million euros ($7.3 million), mayor Nesme said Friday. The intruders sawed through the armoured glass protecting the piece with a power tool before snatching gold and ivory figurines as well as emerald decorations from the piece. The gigantic piece comprises 138 figures encrusted with diamonds and rubies set in marble of various shades and alabaster. As they fled on their motorbikes, the gang sowed spikes across the road to hobble two pursuing vehicles, police said. ""This is a great loss for Paray-le-Monial and for national heritage,"" mayor Nesme said. Staff and around 20 visitors present on the museum's ground floor had been ""traumatised"" by the violent intrusion, he added. The Hieron museum, one of France's oldest for sacred art, has previously been targeted by thieves. Two gold crowns were stolen in 2017, while there was another attempted robbery in 2022. Thursday's theft came a day after several precious objects including ornate snuffboxes were stolen from a central Paris museum.

""A man fired on Sufis taking part in a weekly ritual at a shrine in a remote area of Nahrin district, killing 10 people,"" the ministry's Abdul Matin Qani said. A Nahrin resident, who knew victims of the attack, toldAFPthat worshippers had gathered at the Sayed Pacha Agha shrine on Thursday evening. They had begun a Sufi chant when ""a man shot at the dozen worshippers"", he said on condition of anonymity. ""When people arrived for morning prayers, they discovered the bodies,"" he added. Attacks regularly target participants during rituals or gatherings in Afghanistan, a country with a very large Muslim majority but where the Taliban authorities impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, which is different from Sufism. In April 2022, 33 people, including children, were killed in an explosion that targeted a Sufi mosque during Friday prayers in Kunduz province. The number of bomb attacks has fallen since the Taliban authorities returned to power in 2021, but the regional branch of the Daesh, the Daesh Khorasan, still attack targets they consider heretical. In September, the Daesh Khorasan claimed responsibility for an attack in central Afghanistan that killed 14 people who had gathered to welcome pilgrims returning from the holy site of Karbala in Iraq.","world"

The execution of Carey Grayson, 49, was conducted at the William Holman Correctional Facility in the town of Atmore, where he was pronounced dead at 6:33pm local time, the state's prison authority said in a statement. ""Alabama has successfully used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out Carey Grayson's execution,"" Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement. ""Tonight, justice has been served."" Grayson was sentenced to death for the 1994 murder of Vickie Deblieux, 37, who was killed while hitchhiking from Tennessee to visit her mother in Louisiana. Media witnesses said Grayson cursed at a prison warden when asked if he had a final statement and made an obscene gesture. They said Grayson shook his head from side to side when the gas began to flow into the mask over his face. He gasped for several minutes before he stopped moving and was pronounced dead. Grayson's final meal included soft tacos, beef burritos, guacamole and Mountain Dew Blast, the prison authority said. Grayson, who was 19 at the time, and three other teenagers offered Deblieux a ride but took her instead to a wooded area where they beat her to death and mutilated her body, according to court documents. She was stabbed 180 times, one of her lungs had been removed and her fingers and thumbs were cut off. ""Over 30 years ago, Grayson and his accomplices brutally murdered a complete stranger and mutilated her body,"" Marshall's statement read. ""It takes a truly vicious monster to commit this kind of crime."" Grayson was sentenced to death while the other three participants in the murder, who were under the age of 18 at the time of the crime, are serving life sentences. Alabama carried out the first execution in the United States using nitrogen gas in January and performed a second one in September. The execution is carried out by pumping nitrogen gas into a facemask, causing the prisoner to suffocate. Grayson chose nitrogen gas for his method of execution instead of lethal injection. United Nations experts urged the Alabama authorities on Wednesday to halt the execution. ""This method may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or even torture,"" the eight independent UN rights experts said in a joint statement. ""We reiterate our call for an urgent ban on execution by nitrogen asphyxiation, which is clearly prohibited under international law,"" the experts, who were appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations, said. More broadly, they called on the United States to ""join a growing global consensus towards universal abolition of the death penalty, beginning by promptly imposing a moratorium on executions."" The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while six others — Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee — have moratoriums in place.

"203","How Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's alleged bribery scheme took off, unravelled","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575648-how-indian-billionaire-gautam-adanis-alleged-bribery-scheme-took-off-unravelled","NEW YORK: In June of 2020, a renewable energy company owned by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani won what it called the single largest solar development bid ever awarded: an agreement to supply 8 gigawatts of electricity to a state-owned power company. But there was a problem. Local power companies did not want to pay the prices the state company was offering, jeopardising the deal, according to US authorities. To save the deal, Adani allegedly decided to bribe local officials to persuade them to buy the electricity. That allegation is at the heart of US criminal and civil charges unsealed on Wednesday against Adani, who is not currently in US custody and is believed to be in India. His company, Adani Group, said the charges were ""baseless"" and that it would seek ""all possible legal recourse."" The alleged hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes promised to local Indian officials caught the attention of the US Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission as Adani's companies were raising funds from US-based investors in several transactions starting in 2021. This account of how the alleged scheme unfolded is drawn from federal prosecutors' 54-page criminal indictment of Adani and seven of his associates and two parallel civil SEC complaints, which extensively cite electronic messages between the scheme's alleged participants. In early 2020, the Solar Energy Corporation of India awarded Adani Green Energy and another company, Azure Power Global, contracts for a 12-gigawatt solar energy project, expected to yield billions of dollars in revenue for both companies, according to the indictment. It was a major step forward for Adani Green Energy, run by Adani's nephew, Sagar Adani. Up until that point, the company had only earned roughly $50 million in its history and had yet to turn a profit, according to the SEC complaint. But the initiative soon hit roadblocks. Local state electricity distributors were reluctant to commit to buying the new solar power, expecting prices to fall in the future, according to an April 7, 2021 report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank. Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO at the time discussed the delays and hinted at bribes on the encrypted messaging application WhatsApp, according to the SEC. When the Azure CEO wrote on November 24, 2020, that the local power companies ""are being motivated,"" Sagar Adani allegedly replied, ""Yup ... but the optics are very difficult to cover. In February 2021, Sagar Adani allegedly wrote to the CEO, ""Just so you know, we have doubled the incentives to push for these acceptances."" The SEC did not name the Azure CEO as a defendant, but Azure's securities filings show the CEO at the time was Ranjit Gupta. Gupta was charged by the Justice Department with conspiracy to violate an anti-bribery law. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Azure said on Thursday it was cooperating with the US investigations, and that the individuals involved with the accusations had left the company more than a year ago.","world"
"204","Pam Bondi tapped by Trump for Attorney General role","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575646-pam-bondi-tapped-by-trump-for-attorney-general-role","    WASHINGTON: President-elect Donald Trump announced on Thursday his decision to nominate Pam Bondi, a former Florida Attorney General and close ally, as the next US Attorney General. The announcement comes after embattled Matt Gaetz, his previous nominee, withdrew from consideration amidst controversy. Gaetz was the subject of a House Ethics Committee probe into allegations of having sex with an underage 17-year-old girl and illicit drug use. He has denied wrongdoing. Bondi, 59, was the top law enforcement officer of the country's third most populous state from 2011 to 2019, and served on Trump's Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission during his first administration. Bondi was part of Trump's defense team during his first impeachment trial, in which he was accused of pressuring Ukraine to conduct a corruption investigation into his rival, now-President Joe Biden, by withholding military aid. Trump was later acquitted by the Senate. Most recently, Bondi helped lead the legal arm of the America First Policy Institute, a right-leaning think tank whose personnel has worked closely with Trump's campaign to help shape policy for his incoming administration. Bondi's resume contrasts with that of Gaetz, who has little of the traditional experience expected of an attorney general and who expected to face opposition from Senate Democrats and some Republicans. ""She is certainly qualified for the position on paper,"" said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who now works as a defense attorney with Jones Walker. ""She spent her life prosecuting cases. She has a resume, as compared to the last nominee."" Trump announced his pick of Bondi on social media, praising her for her prosecutorial experience and saying she was tough on crime as Florida's first female attorney general. Trump, who was elected on Nov. 5 despite being the subject of multiple criminal investigations from US and state prosecutors, said Bondi would end the politicization of federal prosecutions. ""For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,"" Trump said. ""Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again."" Trump has railed against the current Justice Department leadership and vowed retribution, after Special Counsel Jack Smith secured two indictments against him over his efforts to subvert the 2020 election and his retention of classified documents after leaving the White House. In her role at the America First Policy Institute, Bondi has remained a staunch defender of Trump. She was among a group of attorneys to draft an amicus brief in the classified documents case in support of Trump which claimed that Smith had been unlawfully appointed. That view was shared by US District Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed the case, prompting the Justice Department to appeal. Smith and top Justice Department officials are now assessing how to wind down both criminal cases against Trump in order to comply with a long-standing Justice Department policy that prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president. Bondi, a conservative who had a reputation during her time as Florida's attorney general for being tough on crime, is expected to carry out Trump's policy agenda. During his first term, Trump was infuriated by what he called an obstructive Justice Department, including attorneys general Jeff Sessions, who allowed a probe into alleged Russian interference, and Bill Barr, who publicly refuted his false claims his 2020 election loss was the result of fraud. The broad contours of Trump's plans for the Justice Department have been communicated through Trump's own public statements, as well as statements by Mark Paoletta, a conservative attorney leading the policy planning for the Justice Department, and in interviews and public forums with former department attorneys. Federal prosecutors will likely be directed to prioritize illegal immigration cases. Cities that hope to receive a slice of the department's more-than-$291 million justice assistance grant program will likely have to agree to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The Civil Rights Division is expected to shift its focus away from police accountability toward defending religious freedom and filing legal challenges against government and private sector diversity, equity and inclusion programs.","world"
"205","IAEA Board passes resolution, pushes Iran towards new nuclear talks","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575639-iaea-board-passes-resolution-pushes-iran-towards-new-nuclear-talks","VIENNA: The Board of Governors of the UN atomic watchdog, comprising 35 member nations, adopted a resolution on Thursday urging Iran to swiftly enhance its cooperation with the agency. The resolution also called for a ""comprehensive"" report, aimed at encouraging Tehran to engage in renewed nuclear negotiations. Britain, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute Iranian move to cap its stock of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said Iran's move was conditional on scrapping the resolution. Iran tends to bristle at such resolutions and has said it would respond in kind to this one. After previous criticism at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board, it has stepped up its nuclear activities and reduced IAEA oversight. China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favour and 12 abstained. The IAEA and Iran have long been locked in standoffs on a range of issues including Tehran's failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites, its barring last year of most of the agency's top uranium-enrichment experts on the Iran inspection team, and its refusal to expand IAEA monitoring. The resolution seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022 resolution that it was ""essential and urgent"" for Iran to explain the uranium traces and let the IAEA take samples as necessary. The resolution in June of this year did the same. The new text asked the IAEA to issue ""a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear programme, including a full account of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA on these issues"". Western powers hope that report, due by spring 2025, will pressure Iran into negotiations on fresh restrictions on its nuclear activities, albeit less far-reaching ones than in a 2015 deal with major powers that unravelled after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018. With Trump due to return to office in January and Iran having taken its uranium enrichment far beyond the deal's limits, it is far from clear whether Trump would back negotiations aimed at setting new limits before the 2015 deal's ones are lifted on ""termination day"" in October of next year. If no new limits are agreed before then, the report could be used to strengthen the case for so-called ""snapback"", a process under the 2015 deal where the issue is sent to the UN Security Council and sanctions lifted under the deal can be re-imposed. Last week IAEA chief Rafael Grossi visited Tehran, hoping to convince new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as relatively moderate, to improve Iran's cooperation with the agency. Grossi formally reported to member states on Tuesday that ""the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed"" in his meetings with Iranian officials, and that the IAEA had verified Iran had ""begun implementation of preparatory measures"". Iran already has enough material enriched to that level, close to the roughly 90% purity that is weapons grade, for four nuclear weapons if enriched further, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough material enriched to lower levels for more bombs, but Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Grossi said on Wednesday he had asked Iran to cap that stock of 60% material and Iran had accepted his request. He told a news conference that day that it was ""a concrete step in the right direction"", suggesting that he felt a resolution could undermine that progress. With the resolution passed, Iran is likely to respond. Moments after the vote, Iranian state media cited a joint statement by the foreign ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran saying Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami has issued orders for measures like activating various new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium. ""If there is a resolution, it (Iran) will either increase its activities or reduce the agency's access,"" a senior diplomat said before the vote.","world"
"206","Why is Indian tycoon Gautam Adani facing US bribery charges?","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575506-why-is-indian-tycoon-gautam-adani-facing-us-bribery-charges","MUMBAI: The business empire of Gautam Adani is again in turmoil after the billionaire Indian tycoon was charged in the United States with paying exorbitant bribes to secure lucrative government contracts. Adani, 62, is a publicity-shy school dropout of humble origins who rose to become fabulously rich. Moving to Mumbai in his teens to work sorting diamonds, he formed his own import-export business. His big break came in 1995 when he acquired a shipping port just as India's economy was opening up. Today, Adani Group has interests in everything from power generation and Australian coal mines to cement, media, food, airport terminals and Israeli ports. The meteoric rise in the share prices of Adani's units — the flagship Adani Enterprises rose more than 1,000% in five years — helped make the conglomerate staggeringly wealthy and fund further expansion. Adani is considered a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarat native. The tycoon's conglomerate offered Modi the use of a private company jet during the 2014 election campaign that swept his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to office. Two years ago, Adani executed a hostile takeover of broadcasterNDTV, a television news service considered one of the few media outlets willing to outwardly criticise Modi. Adani batted away press freedom fears, but told theFinancial Timesthat journalists should have the ""courage"" to say ""when the government is doing the right thing every day"". Critics, including Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, have accused Adani of improperly benefitting from his relationship with Modi to win business and avoid proper oversight — allegations Adani Group and its founder have consistently denied. Wednesday's indictment in New York accuses Adani Group's leadership of paying more than $250 million to Indian government officials to secure lucrative contracts worth more than $2 billion. It further charges Adani and seven other officials with lying about the bribery in order to raise capital from international investors, including those in the United States. ""These offences were allegedly committed by senior executives and directors to obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of US investors,"" US Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said in a statement. The indictment accuses Adani of personally meeting with an Indian government official to ""advance"" the bribery scheme, and of meeting with other defendants to ""discuss aspects of its execution"". Adani Group acknowledged the charges against its founder and several others on Thursday when it cancelled a US bond sale it initiated just hours before the indictment was published. But it has not otherwise commented on the allegations against the tycoon or his subordinates, none of whom have been taken into custody. Modi's government has likewise yet to comment, but BJP spokesman Amit Malviya said in a statement that the indictment appeared to implicate opposition parties, rather than the prime minister's. Jairam Ramesh, of India's key opposition Congress Party, said the indictment ""vindicates"" their demand for a parliamentary inquiry into Adani. He added that the indictment demonstrated what he called the ""abject failure"" of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to properly investigate Adani Group in the past. Last year, Hindenburg Research — an activist US investment group that bets on stocks falling — accused Adani Group of committing ""a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"". This included funnelling money from offshore accounts controlled by Adani's brother, Vinod Adani, into listed units to inflate their share prices. The Hindenburg report has sparked a huge sell-off in shares in Adani's firms, wiping out more than $150 billion in market value in the following weeks. Adani's finance chief dismissed the report as a ""malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India's highest courts"".","world"
"207","Iceland volcano erupts for 10th time in three years","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575508-iceland-volcano-erupts-for-10th-time-in-three-years","A volcano near Iceland's capital erupted late on Wednesday for the 10th time in three years, spewing fountains of lava and smoke, the country's meteorological office said, but there were no disruptions to air traffic or infrastructure. Iceland, with nearly 400,000 inhabitants, is located on the fault line between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, making it a seismic hotspot with geysers, warm-water springs and dozens of volcanoes. Social media livestreams from the area showed glowing hot lava in bright yellow and orange shades shooting up into the night sky. The first signs of an eruption were recorded just 45 minutes before a massive ground fissure, now estimated to be around three kilometres long, was opened by magma forcing its way through the earth's crust, Iceland's meteorological office said. Authorities had previously warned of volcanic activity as magma accumulated beneath the Reykjanes peninsula, some 30km southwest of the capital Reykjavik, where the most recent eruption ended only on September 6. However, there had been no noticeable increase in seismic activity in recent weeks, the meteorological office said. Wednesday's eruption was estimated to be significantly smaller than the previous one, it added. The outbreaks on the Reykjanes peninsula, known as fissure eruptions, have not directly affected the capital city and do not cause significant dispersals of ash into the stratosphere, avoiding air traffic disruption. Reykjavik's Keflavik Airport said on its website that flights were unaffected and no crucial infrastructure was in danger, but the Blue Lagoon, a luxury geothermal spa resort, had shut down and evacuated its guests, according to public broadcasterRUV. The nearby fishing town of Grindavik, home to nearly 4,000 residents before an evacuation order in December last year, remains mostly deserted due to the periodic threat from lava flows. There was no indication that lava was flowing towards the town, but some 50 houses occupied by people who have returned were evacuated, the civil protection agency said in a statement. Lying dormant for 800 years, the geological systems in the area reactivated in 2021 and have since erupted at rising frequency, with the latest outbreak being the sixth so far in 2024. Experts have warned that Reykjanes is likely to experience repeated volcanic outbreaks for decades, possibly even centuries.","world"

Gandhi's demand came after shares in the industrialist's conglomerate nosedived nearly 20% in Mumbai, the morning after a bombshell indictment in New York accused him of deliberately misleading international investors. Adani is a close ally of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was at one point the world's second-richest man, and critics have long accused him of improperly benefitting from their relationship. ""We demand that Adani be immediately arrested. But we know that won't happen as Modi is protecting him,"" Gandhi told reporters in New Delhi. ""Modi can't act even if he wants to, because he is controlled by Adani."" Wednesday's indictment accuses Adani and multiple subordinates of paying huge sums of more than $250 million in bribes to Indian officials for lucrative solar energy supply contracts. The deals were projected to generate more than $2 billion in profits after tax over roughly 20 years. None of the multiple defendants named in the case are in custody. Adani and two other board members of his Adani Group ""lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from US and international investors"", US attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. The indictment drove steep losses in flagship listed unit Adani Enterprises and multiple other subsidiaries immediately after the Mumbai stock exchange reopened on Thursday. The conglomerate's renewable energy subsidiary acknowledged the charges against the tycoon and two other Adani Group board members in a brief statement. Adani Green Energy said it had decided to halt a planned bond sale ""in light of these developments"", but did not offer further comment on the allegations. His nephew and board member Sagar Adani, also named in the indictment, toldAFPin October that there was ""no political connection"" between Adani Group and the Modi government. ""We basically set up what the government really needs, in their best interest,"" he added. ""All the projects we got have not been granted by any concession but through an independent and transparent auction system.""

The decision, approved during a syndicate meeting chaired by Vice-Chancellor Professor Niaz Ahmad Khan on November 13, was confirmed by Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Admin) Prof Sayma Haque Bidisha,The Newsreported. Under the updated policy, Pakistani students will now be eligible to enroll at Dhaka University, while Bangladeshi students will similarly be encouraged to pursue higher education opportunities in Pakistan. University officials expect that the move will strengthen collaboration in education, culture, and other areas of mutual interest. Explaining the decision, Prof Bidisha said that while ties with Pakistan had been severed in the past, the university recognised its responsibility as an academic institution to facilitate opportunities for students. “At one point, ties with Pakistan were cut, but Dhaka University is an academic institution. Many of our students need to visit Pakistan for scholarships or academic conferences,” she said “We resolved this issue through discussion to restore normal relations,” she added. The decision was made purely from an academic perspective and did not involve any discussions on sensitive political matters. “This is about academic cooperation, not political dialogue,” Bidisha added. The ban had been in place since December 2015, when an emergency syndicate meeting led by then-Vice-Chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique imposed the restriction.","world"

Getting a deal on the money has proved slow-going at the talks in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku, and the latest draft of the negotiating text arrived several hours later than scheduled as delegates entered, in theory, the closing 48 hours. While the summit is set to wrap up on Friday, the new document showed much remains to be decided on key questions, such as what counts towards the annual figure, who pays and how much. ""We are far from the finish line,"" said Li Shuo, a climate diplomacy expert at the Asia Society Policy Institute. ""The new finance text presents two extreme ends of the aisle without much in between."" Developing countries need at least $1 trillion annually by the end of the decade to cope with climate change, economists told the UN talks last week. Although the 10-page document was slimmed to less than half the size of the previous version by stripping out some options, it summed up the opposing positions of blocs of developed and developing nations established before the event. One focused on ensuring the funds were grants or grant-equivalent in form, and that contributions from developing countries to each other - a nod to large potential donors such as China - were not formally part of the target. The other, repeating the position of richer countries, aimed to broaden the types of finance that count toward the final annual goal, not just grants from developed countries, and included contributions from others. Both options avoided specifying the total amount of money that countries would aim to invest each year, leaving the space marked with an 'X'. ""Crucially, the text misses a number that defines the scale of future climate finance, a prerequisite for negotiation in good faith,"" Li added. That was perhaps not surprising as key donor countries, including those in the European Union, have said they want more clarity on the structure and contributor base before publicly discussing how much they could chip in.","world"

Makary raised concerns about a number of public health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, touting the protection from natural immunity and opposing COVID vaccine mandates. The FDA is the world's most influential drug regulator with a more than $7 billion budget. It is responsible for approving new treatments and assuring they are safe and effective before entering the biggest and most lucrative market. It has regulatory authority over human and veterinary drugs, biological medicines, medical devices and vaccines. The agency is also responsible for maintaining safety standards for the food supply, tobacco, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the Trump transition team, said he would not speculate on or get ahead of any announcement. As FDA commissioner, Makary would report to the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. To lead HHS, Trump has nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist who has spread misinformation about the safety of vaccines and one of several unconventional Trump picks for top administration jobs. As a doctor, Makary was a co-developer of the Surgery Checklist, a routine for surgeons that improved patient outcomes and has been spread around the globe by the World Health Organization. His most recent book, ""Blind Spots"", was published in September. In interviews promoting the book, he spoke against what he called ""massive overtreatment"" in the US that he called ""an epidemic of inappropriate care."" He has advocated for reexamining the use of hormone replacement treatment in menopausal women, reducing overuse of antibiotics and reforms to medical education. Makary, who lives in Baltimore, has served as an adviser to Washington conservative healthcare think tank Paragon Health Institute. If confirmed by the Senate, he would succeed Dr. Robert Califf, a cardiologist and researcher who also held the role of FDA commissioner in the Obama administration. In his second term, Califf revamped the agency's food operations and inspections processes and tried to combat misinformation.","world"

The strikes were widely reported by Russian war correspondents on Telegram and confirmed by an official on condition of anonymity. A spokesperson for Ukraine's general staff said he had no such information at present. Moscow has said the use of Western weapons to strike into Russian territory far from the border would be a major escalation in the conflict. Kyiv says it needs the capability to defend itself by hitting Russian rear bases used to support Moscow's invasion, which entered its thousandth day this week. Russian war correspondent accounts on Telegram posted footage they said included the sound of the missiles striking in Kursk region. At least 14 huge explosions can be heard, most of them preceded by the sharp whistle of what sounds like an incoming missile. The footage, shot in a residential area, showed black smoke rising in the distance. The pro-Russian Two Majors Telegram channel said Ukraine had fired up to 12 Storm Shadows into the Kursk region, and carried pictures of pieces of missile with the name Storm Shadow clearly visible. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his office would not be commenting on reports or operational matters. Britain had previously allowed Ukraine to use Storm Shadows within Ukrainian  territory. The Kyiv government has been pressing Western partners for  permission to use such weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, and obtained the all-clear from U.S. President Joe Biden to use the ATACMS  this week, two months before Biden leaves office. Biden's successor, President-elect Donald Trump, has said he will end the war,  without saying how. The warring sides have interpreted this as likely to involve a push for peace talks - not known to have been held since the  war's earliest months - and are trying to seize a strong position before negotiations. The Storm Shadows have a range in excess of 250 km (155 miles) and would  give Ukraine the ability to hit targets far deeper into Russia than  before. Kyiv says Moscow, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, has previously  taken advantage of limits on its use of weapons, particularly to strike  Ukrainian cities from the air with heavy guided bombs. Western countries say the arrival of more than 10,000 North Korean troops to  fight for Russia in recent weeks was an escalation that merited a  response. The first use of the U.S. ATACMS on Tuesday, fired at a Russian arsenal in  the Bryansk region, prompted firm words from Moscow, which announced a  change to its nuclear doctrine to lower the threshold for the use of  atomic weapons. Washington has said it sees no need to adjust its own  nuclear posture and accused Moscow of resorting to irresponsible  rhetoric. Military analysts have said the longer range missiles are unlikely to give  Ukraine a decisive edge in the war but could help it strengthen its  position, especially in the battle for a sliver of land inside Russia's  Kursk region it seized in August. With tension higher over the use of the missiles, the United States shut its embassy in Kyiv on Wednesday morning ""out of an abundance of caution""  due to what it called the threat of a significant air attack. An air raid siren in the early afternoon jangled nerves in the capital.  But Ukraine's military spy agency said a widely reported threat of drone and missile attacks on a huge scale across the country was fake, and  accused Russia of trying to sow panic by circulating online messages  about it. ""The enemy, unable to subdue Ukrainians by force, resorts to measures of  intimidation and psychological pressure on society. We ask you to be  vigilant and steadfast,"" it said. The Italian and Greek embassies said they too had closed their doors. The  French embassy remained open but urged its citizens to be cautious. The  Kremlin said it had no comment. Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin said in an interview published on Wednesday that Moscow would retaliate against NATO countries that facilitate long-range Ukrainian missile strikes against Russian territory. The war is at a volatile juncture, with nearly a fifth of Ukrainian  territory in Russian hands, North Korean troops deployed in Russia's  Kursk region and doubts over the future of Western aid under Trump,  whose nominees for administration posts include sceptics of support for  Kyiv. On Sunday, Russia staged a missile and drone strike on Ukraine's national  power grid that killed seven people and renewed fears over the  durability of the hobbled energy network.","world"

It posted a video of the animals in cargo boxes being unloaded off a government plane, and another of the lion in its new enclosure at the Pyongyang Zoo. Putin previously gifted Kim 24 purebred horses, known to be Kim's favourite, while Kim sent Putin a pair of local dogs. The two countries, both under heavy Western sanctions, signed a mutual defence pact earlier this year that obligates them to provide immediate military assistance if the other is invaded. Western capitals, as well as Ukraine and South Korea, say North Korea has recently deployed more than 10,000 of its troops to Russia, to be sent into combat against Kyiv´s forces.","world"
"217","OPEC Secretary General tells COP29 oil is a gift from God","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575391-opec-secretary-general-tells-cop29-oil-is-a-gift-from-god","  BAKU: OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais on Wednesday told the COP29 climate summit in Baku that crude oil and natural gas were a gift from God, and that global warming talks should focus on cutting emissions not picking energy sources. The comments came as world governments seeking to limit the damage from global warming gathered in the Caspian Sea nation of Azerbaijan to hash out a sweeping finance deal meant to help countries cut emissions and adapt to the changing climate. ""They are indeed a gift of God,"" Al Ghais, a veteran Kuwaiti oil executive, said about oil and gas in a speech at the conference. ""They impact how we produce and package and transport food and how we undertake medical research, manufacture and distribute medical supplies. I could go on forever,"" he added. His words echoed those of Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, who used his opening address to the summit last week to hit back at Western critics of his country's oil and gas industry, and who also described those resources as a gift from God. Al Ghais said that world governments, which had agreed to limit planetary warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels at the 2015 summit in Paris, could pursue their climate targets without shunning petroleum. ""The focus of the Paris Agreement is reducing emissions, not choosing energy sources,"" he said. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has said that technologies like carbon capture can tackle the climate impact of burning fossil fuels. Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, Mohamed Hamel, a grouping of gas exporter nations, also spoke to the conference on Wednesday in support of fossil fuels. ""As the world's population grows, the economy expands, and human living conditions improve, the world will need more natural gas, not less,"" he said. He added that he hoped that a COP29 deal on international climate finance would allow support for natural gas projects to help countries transition away from dirtier fuels like coal. ""The outcome of COP 29 should facilitate financing for natural gas projects and scaling up cleaner technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage,"" he said. ""This is crucial for ensuring just inclusive and orderly energy transitions that leave no one behind,"" he added. Climate scientists say the world is now likely to cross the 1.5°C threshold — beyond which catastrophic climate impacts could occur — in the early 2030s, if not before. The world is currently on track for as much as 3.1°C of warming by the end of this century, according to the 2024 UN Emissions Gap report.","world"
"218","Donald Trump's contentious cabinet picks stir heated #MeToo debate","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575322-donald-trumps-contentious-cabinet-picks-stir-heated-metoo-debate","With his imminent return to the White House in January, United States President-elect Donald Trump is set to make history as the country's first president found liable in a court case for sexual abuse. But, according toa news analysis by theNew York Times, if Trump gets the team of his choice, he will not be the only one in the room whose conduct has been called into question. During his re-election campaign, the 78-year-old Republican politician was wound up in a series of cases against him, including a civil trial last year in which he was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming the writer E Jean Carroll. However, he still denies the accusations despite Carroll winning two civil court judgments against him for $83.3 million. Similarly, Trump also said that over two dozen other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct were all lying. Additionally, he is now assembling a cabinet filled with individuals similarly accused of variations of sexual misconduct and deny allegations against them just like Trump has. His selections have raised significant concerns regarding the future of the #MeToo movement, a movement which profoundly impacted societal expectations around sexual misconduct over the past few years, theNew York Timesreported. The kind of accusations that took down titans of Hollywood, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Washington, the news media, sports and state capitals have proved no obstacle in Trump’s selection process. Despite numerous allegations against several of his appointees, Trump proceeded to select individuals for key positions in his administration. He has appointed Matt Gaetz to head the Justice Department despite knowing that the Republican congressman has previously faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct. Likewise, accusations against Robert F Kennedy Jr regarding inappropriate behaviour toward a family babysitter did not deter Trump from choosing him to run the health department. Trump also overlooked claims that tech billionaire Elon Musk fostered a sexually charged workplace that treated women as objects while tasking him with reinventing government. All of his nominees have denied intentional wrongdoing, and Trump appears to take them at their word. ""It really feels like that’s part of what makes this cabinet appealing” to him, said Leigh Gilmore, the author of 'The #MeToo Effect: What Happens When We Believe Women'. ""Credible accusations of sexual assault aren’t a red line, because those are a feature of Trump’s own biography."" ""The more people he can surround himself with that are not in any way slowed down by their rise to power by these kinds of allegations, it normalizes his own behavior,"" said Gilmore. ""He's creating a worldview. He's shifting norms as he moves.""","world"
"219","Factbox: COP29 climate talks enter final stretch; what happens next?","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575316-factbox-cop29-climate-talks-enter-final-stretch-what-happens-next","Marathon COP29 climate talks enter their final stretch on Wednesday when the Azerbaijani hosts are due to publish an update on negotiations so far as the summit seeks to agree a new goal on issues including climate finance. The talks, which began on November 11, are due to end on Friday at 1400GMT, but COP summits have a history of running long. Below is a breakdown of the known sticking points and what happens next: Officials spent the first week trying to agree deals across a range of different issues including finance, carbon markets, the future of fossil fuels and efforts to mitigate the rise in global temperatures. Now, the outstanding items have been handed over to ministers so they can use their political clout to try to get agreements across the line. The next steps are about trying to whittle down draft texts containing a huge range of wording options into a final document that can be adopted by consensus at the end of the summit. Draft texts will be published periodically by the Azerbaijani presidency as they zero in on an acceptable deal. The primary aim of COP29 is to agree a new target for how much money should be provided to developing countries to help them adapt to climate-fuelled weather disasters and transition to cleaner energy systems. A previous goal to provide $100 billion per year expires in 2025. The new goal needs to be $1 trillion annually by the end of the decade, according to experts. The focus in the negotiating rooms has been on defining the structure of a new target, including what counts as climate finance and who needs to pay in. Only once that is agreed are parties expected to start talking about the size of the target. Among issues to iron out include whether countries such as China should be counted among the richer core donors, and the degree to which countries should provide finance in the form of grants or loans. A text has been scheduled for publication on Wednesday evening. Countries have so far struggled to agree on the right way to follow up on a deal at last year's summit to transition from fossil fuels. European states want to see that commitment referenced throughout any deal at Baku to reinforce the importance of following through with firm action. Others, including the Arab Group of states, argue it does not need to be. If past COPs are anything to go by, the moment any deal text is published, delegates will be searching for the phrase ""fossil fuels"" to see if there is any sign of backsliding. Talks in Baku began with an early deal on some of the quality standards that would govern a global market for carbon credits, but there is still much to be agreed on, including how to track trades and disclosure rules. If fully agreed, market watchers expect a UN-backed global market could fund billions of dollars of projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from projects such as reforestation. Scrutiny of the details is intense amid concern that without watertight regulation carbon credits may not deliver the benefits they claim. COPs rarely finish on time. COP28 in Dubai closed almost a full day after the initial deadline; COP27 in Egypt overran by around 36 hours. In the final hours, delegations consult intensively in private with the presidency on the proposed deal, often through the night, in search of something that can be adopted by consensus. Once finalised, every country is called to the main hall to begin an hours-long process of formal approval.","world"

India’s ruling party has been hit with widespread criticism for promoting anti-Muslim sentiment because of a video advertisement. The video was released as part of an election campaign on Saturday in eastern India’s Jharkand state. It shows Muslims taking over a house in India for breaching the Commission’s code of conduct, reportedAl Jazeera. Additionally, a woman is depicted gesturing as if the newcomers bring an unpleasant odour, while Muslim children dirty the furniture, and women fully covered in hijabs and niqabs appear to take over the house, reportedThe New Arab. The video has been deemed to perpetuate the prejudice against Muslim minority as the controversy stems from the advert's depiction of Muslims entering the home of an opposition supporter. It is important to note that “Islamophobia” has been a consistent theme in BJP campaigns. Earlier, during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a BJP-affiliated X account based in southwest India’s Karnataka shared an inflammatory animation that alleged that Congress was facilitating Muslim dominance over other communities. The Election Commission of India (ECI), in response to the controversy, ordered the removal of the video from the BJP’s social media platforms on Sunday. Moreover, it stated that the video appeared to violate the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in place during the elections. As a result, the BJP has since removed the ad from all online platforms.","world"
"221","Children's wellbeing 'under threat' in 2050, warns Unicef","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575266-childrens-wellbeing-under-threat-in-2050-warns-unicef","Demographic shifts, worsening climate change and rapid technological transformation risk creating a bleak future for youth in the mid-21st century, the United Nations agency for children warned Tuesday in an annual report. ""Children are experiencing a myriad of crises, from climate shocks to online dangers, and these are set to intensify in the years to come,"" Catherine Russell, executive director of United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (Unicef), wrote in a statement marking the release of the agency's annual report. ""Decades of progress, particularly for girls, are under threat."" The report was released by the UN agency for children a day before the World Children's Day. This day is commemorated every year on November 20 since 1954 when the UN designated this day to promote international togetherness, awareness among children worldwide, and improving children's welfare. This year, Unicef uses its report to project forward to 2050 identifying three ""major trends"" that in addition to unpredictable conflicts pose threats to children unless policymakers make changes. The first risk is demographic change, with the number of children expected to remain similar to current figures of 2.3 billion, but they will represent a smaller share of the larger and ageing global population of around 10 billion. While the proportion of children will decline across all regions, their numbers will explode in some of the poorest areas, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This offers the potential to boost economic growth, but only if the new young population has access to quality education, health care, and jobs, UNICEF notes. In some developed countries, children could make up less than 10% of the population by 2050, raising concerns about their ""visibility"" and rights in societies focused on aging populations. The second threat is climate change. If current greenhouse gas emission trends continue, by 2050 children could face eight times more heatwaves than in 2000, three times more extreme flooding, and 1.7 times more wildfires, Unicef projects. New technology, particularly artificial intelligence, has the potential to power new innovation and progress but could also widen existing inequalities between rich and poor countries. An estimated 95% of people in developed nations have internet access, compared to just 26% in the least developed, often due to a lack of electricity, connectivity, or devices. ""Failure to remove barriers for children in these countries, especially for those living in the poorest households, means letting an already disadvantaged generation fall even further behind,"" according to Unicef. Being connected also carries risks. The unchecked proliferation of new technologies poses threats to children and their personal data, making them vulnerable to online predators. ""Children of the future face many risks, but what we wanted to demonstrate is that the solutions are in the hands of todays decision-makers,"" Cecile Aptel, deputy director of Unicef's research division, toldAFP.","world"
"222","Tens of thousands march in New Zealand Maori rights protest","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575261-tens-of-thousands-march-in-new-zealand-maori-rights-protest","  WELLINGTON: Booming Indigenous Maori ""haka"" chants rang out across New Zealand's capital on Tuesday, as tens of thousands rallied against a conservative push to redefine the nation's founding treaty. More than 35,000 demonstrators poured into the harbour side city of Wellington, police said, shutting down busy streets as their spirited procession inched its way towards parliament. Bare-chested men draped in traditional feather cloaks were joined by horse riders waving the red, white and black Maori flag. Children marched alongside adults bearing distinctive full-face Maori ""moko"" tattoos and clutching ceremonial wooden weapons. Protests have been swelling throughout New Zealand after a minor party in the conservative coalition government drafted a bill to redefine the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. Although the bill has almost no chance of passing, its mere introduction has triggered one of New Zealand's largest protests in decades. After it was presented for debate in parliament last week, 22-year-old Maori Party MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke took to her feet in the chamber, ripped the bill in half, and launched into a haka. She joined the crowds of protesters gathered on the lawns Tuesday outside New Zealand's beehive-shaped parliament building. ""I may have been suspended for 24 hours and not let into the gates of the debating chambers, but the next day I showed up outside the steps with a hundred thousand of my people, marching with our heads held high and our flags waving with pride,"" she told them. ""We are the king makers, we are the sovereign people of this land and the world is watching us here."" Many critics of the bill — including some of New Zealand's most respected lawyers — see it as an attempt to strip long-agreed rights from the country's 900,000 strong Maori population. ""It's not the best way to have a conversation. We will not accept unilateral change to a treaty that involves two parties,"" said Ngira Simmonds, a key advisor to New Zealand's Maori queen. ""There is a better way,"" he toldAFPfrom Wellington. Many demonstrators arrived in Wellington after a nine-day ""hikoi"" — or protest march — that began hundreds of kilometres away at New Zealand's northern tip.","world"
"223","Trump, Musk witness SpaceX Starship launch as booster misses landing","https://www.geo.tv/latest/575251-donald-trump-elon-musk-witness-spacex-starships-latest-test-flight","Elon Musk's SpaceX launched its giant Starship rocket to space from Texas on Tuesday, advancing the ship's spaceflight abilities but botching an attempt to bring its booster back to land as US President-elect Donald Trump watched from the company's rocket facilities. The roughly 400-foot-tall (122-meter-tall) rocket system, designed to land astronauts on the moon and ferry crews to Mars, lifted off at 4pm CT from SpaceX's sprawling rocket development site in Boca Chica, Texas. The rocket's 233-foot-tall (71-metre-tall) first-stage booster, called Super Heavy, detached from its second stage, Starship, at roughly 62 kilometres in altitude, sending the craft into space. Super Heavy unexpectedly splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico instead of returning to land, where it was expected to fall into large mechanical arms attached to the tower it launched from. The last-minute diversion to water indicated something went wrong. A live stream separate from SpaceX's and hosted by space blogger Everyday Astronaut showed the Super Heavy booster exploding into a massive fireball on the Gulf horizon after splashing down. Starship last month demonstrated the novel catch-landing method for the first time, achieving a key milestone in its reusable design. Tuesday's catch-landing was supposed to be ""faster/harder,"" Musk had written on social media before the launch. After the October 14 Starship test, Trump was intrigued, fixating on the booster's novel catch-landing technique. ""Did you see the way that sucker landed today?"" he said at a rally that day. The rest of the mission appeared successful. In space, the Starship travelled around Earth for a daytime splashdown in the Indian Ocean roughly an hour later. It re-ignited one of its onboard engines in space for the first time, an early test of its manoeuvrability in space that SpaceX had tried but failed to do in past flights. NASA chief Bill Nelson, who is expected to leave his role once Trump takes office in January, congratulated SpaceX in a post on X and said Starship's in-space engine re-ignition marked ""major progress towards orbital flight."" Trump's attendance signals a deepening alliance with Musk, who stands to benefit from Trump's election victory. The billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is expected to wield extraordinary influence to help his companies and secure favourable government treatment. The world's wealthiest person, Musk was a prominent supporter of Trump's presidential election campaign, appearing with him at rallies and backing him with at least $119 million in political support. ""I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space but simply by lifting off the ground,"" Trump wrote on social media, wishing Musk luck on the launch. Trump on November 13 appointed Musk as co-leader of a new government efficiency project that the SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO has said will rid the federal government of wasteful spending and regulations he has called burdensome. The US Federal Aviation Administration's regulation of commercial rocket launches has been a source of frustration for Musk, who has complained that the agency impedes his company's progress in getting to Mars. But the FAA's license approval of Tuesday's Starship launch a little over a month after the rocket's previous flight was its quickest regulatory turnaround yet for SpaceX, as the agency develops new launch-approval processes meant to keep pace with the US space industry's growth. Musk on Tuesday listed four core objectives for the test flight: restarting Starship's space-tailored engine during flight, making a more visible ocean landing during the daytime - past attempts have been at night - putting Starship through more intense heat during reentry, and making the booster landing faster. ""There are thousands of small design changes also being tested,"" said Musk. SpaceX is eyeing swift advances in Starship development during the second Trump administration. The administration's space agenda is expected to give NASA's Artemis program, which is due to return astronauts to the lunar surface, a greater focus on the more ambitious goal of landing people on Mars, Musk's premier space aspiration. ""We just passed 400 launches on Falcon, and I would not be surprised if we fly 400 Starship launches in the next four years,"" said SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell at the Baron Investment Conference in New York last week, referring to the company's workhorse rocket.","world"

Describing McMahon as a ""fierce advocate for Parents' Rights,"" Trump said in a statement: ""We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort."" McMahon is a co-chair of Trump's transition team ahead of his return to the White House in January. It is tasked with filling some 4,000 positions in the government. Regarding McMahon's experience in education, Trump cited her two-year stint on the Connecticut Board of Education and 16 years on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University, a private Catholic school. McMahon left WWE in 2009 to run in vain for US Senate, and has been a major donor to Trump. Since 2021, she has chaired the Center For The American Worker at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute. During the election campaign Trump promised to do away with the federal education department when he returns to the White House. ""I say it all the time. I'm dying to get back to do this. We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education,"" he said in September during a rally in Wisconsin. At the Republican convention in Milwaukee, McMahon said she was ""privileged to call Donald Trump a colleague and a boss,"" as well as ""a friend."" Her ties with Trump go back to her years in the professional wrestling industr — she said she first met him as chief executive at WWE. At the culmination of a staged feud, Trump once body-slammed her husband, legendary wrestling promoter Vince McMahon, and shaved his head in the middle of a wrestling ring on live television. In 2017, she was confirmed as the head of the Small Business Administration, which is responsible for supporting America's millions of small businesses, which employ around half the country's private-sector workforce. In nominating her, Trump pointed to her experience in business, helping to grow the WWE. After leaving the administration, she served as chair of the pro-Trump America First Action SuperPAC, or political action committee.","world"

Documents seized by police revealed a plan to shoot or poison Lula and his Vice  President-elect Geraldo Alckmin and put two retired army generals,  National Security Adviser Augusto Heleno and former Defense Minister  Braga Netto, in charge of leading the country with the idea of holding new elections. The conspiracy included the attempted murder of a Supreme Court justice with an explosive device or poison, police said in a statement. The Army confirmed the arrests of retired Brigadier General Mario  Fernandes, who had served as a deputy minister in Bolsonaro's cabinet,  and Lieutenant Colonels Helio Ferreira Lima, Rodrigo Bezerra de Azevedo and Rafael Martins de Oliveira. The officers were in Rio de Janeiro but were not involved in the security operation for the summit of leaders of the G20 group of major economies in the city, according to the Army statement. Most of the men under investigation in the alleged 2022 coup plot are military personnel with Special Forces training, or close aides to  Bolsonaro, a hard-right former army officer who won the presidency in  2018. The arrests were the first time the federal police had described a plot to kill Lula and Alckmin and stage a coup to prevent him from returning to power. Police identified the main plotter as Fernandes, who was found in possession of a plot outline that had been printed at the presidential palace. ""A detailed operational plan called 'Green and Yellow Dagger' was identified, which would be executed on December 15, 2022, aimed at the murder of the elected candidates for president and vice president,"" the police said in a statement. Federal police served five arrest warrants on Tuesday, without naming the men arrested, as well as three search and seizure warrants and other 15  precautionary measures. These included banning suspects from contacting others and forbidding them from leaving the country. ""Investigations indicate that the criminal organisation used a high level of technical-military knowledge to plan, coordinate and execute illicit actions in November and December 2022,"" the police statement said. Lula defeated Bolsonaro in a presidential election in October 2022 and the leftist leader took office on Jan. 1, 2023. Bolsonaro had filled his government with military officers, many of them opposed to Lula. Bolsonaro left Brazil days before Lula's inauguration for Florida and never recognised his electoral defeat. He eventually returned to Brazil and is under investigation for his alleged role in encouraging the riots in Brasilia on Jan. 8, 2023, when his supporters stormed and vandalised government buildings in the capital, hoping to cause chaos and spur the military to take power. A federal police investigation will conclude that Bolsonaro conspired to engineer the attempted coup after he lost the election, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told Reuters. The probe is expected to be finished this month. Bolsonaro has made no public comment on the coup plot allegations. Reuters was trying to reach representatives of the former president and Fernandes for comment. The Brazilian army monitored the federal operation against the coup plotters, which was carried out on Tuesday in Brasilia and Rio de  Janeiro, Goias and Amazonas states. According to the sources Reuters spoke to, the plotters also planned to kill  Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who led investigations into  Bolsonaro for abuse of power and unproven attacks on Brazil's voting system when he was president and banned him from running for elected office until 2030. More than 2,000 people were arrested for participating in the January 2023  uprising in Brasilia, although most were later released. Others have been convicted by the Supreme Court on charges of involvement in an attempted coup.","world"

Russia said its forces shot down five out of six missiles, which were fired at a military facility in the Bryansk region. Debris of one hit the facility, starting a fire swiftly put out and caused no casualties or damage, it said. Ukraine said it struck a Russian arms depot about 110 km (70 miles) inside  Russia in an attack that caused secondary explosions. Ukraine's military did not publicly specify what weapons it had used, but a Ukrainian government source and a US official confirmed it had used ATACMS. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russia was able to intercept two out of eight missiles fired by Ukraine and that the strike was at an ammunition supply point. Biden approved this week for Ukraine to use ATACMS, the longest-range missiles Washington has supplied, for such attacks inside Russia. Moscow has described their potential use as an escalation that would make  Washington a direct combatant in the war and prompt Russian retaliation. The attack took place as Ukraine marked 1,000 days of war, with a fifth of  Ukrainian territory in Moscow's hands and doubts about the future of  Western support as Donald Trump heads back to the White House. The permission to use ATACMS gives Ukraine a new US ballistic missile capability inside Russia. However, its range of up to 300 km is much shorter than that of some missiles Moscow has used to strike Ukraine,  including its hypersonic Kinzhal weapon with a reported range of up to 2,000 km. Military experts say using the US missiles to attack positions so deep in  Russia can help Ukraine defend a pocket of Russian territory it captured as a bargaining chip but is not likely to have a decisive impact on the course of the 33-month-old war, in part because the move came far too late. Moscow has said such weapons cannot be used without direct operational support from the United States, and therefore their use would make Washington a direct participant in the war. On Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin signed a new nuclear doctrine that appeared intended as a warning to Washington. It lowers the threshold under which Russia might use atomic weapons including responding to attacks that threaten its territorial integrity.","world"

According toExpressthe expert said, “Any Royal involved in illegal activities is a great story, the only problem with this was, this was spin.” And while he did add, “This had not happened as they said. What had happened was that Harry had gone to this drug rehabilitation place two or three weeks beforehand.” However, when the time came, “It was spun then to try and show people that 'don't worry, dad's taken care of it. He's taken him to a drug rehabilitation unit to show him the evils of his ways.'"" Even a longtime admirer of now-Queen Camilla, Patronella Wyatt, admits “I think it was a very bad decision on Bolland's part.” For those unversed, Mark Bolland was King Charles’ communications secretary at the time. He had worked with editor Rebekah Wade to try and rehabilitate King Charles, and Queen Camilla’s image in their early days after marriage.

It does look like a son being sacrificed to make his father look better.” The prince even addressed this himself after he had left the Royal Family for good, with Meghan Markle. It was around 2023, and according to Express UK the Duke of Sussex admitted, “Those certain members have decided to get in the bed with the devil, right? To rehabilitate their image. If you need to do that, or you want to do that, you choose to do that — well, that is a choice. That's up to you.”","entertainment"

For those unversed, this revelation has come amid reports that Prince Harry may soon face a hard choice of leaving the US should he be deemed a ‘liar’ on his immigration papers. The lies in question pertain to his drug use, which bar a person from entering the US, but were admitted to in the memoirSpare. According toThe Mirror,royal author Tom Quinn recalled how it all played out, back when Queen Elizabeth was monarch and said, “Six months in the U.K. as a working royal followed by six months in the States would boost brand Sussex which is less and less interesting without the working royal angle.” According to the author, this plan was the brainchild of Meghan, but as is known, was shot down almost immediately by Queen Elizabeth who felt you’re either ‘in or out’. However, they still had hope after King Charles took the throne because “Meghan and Harry had always hoped that when Queen Elizabeth died, Charles would take a less strict view of what it means to be a working royal.” But what ended up harming the royals more than Megxit, was the fact that US fans were ‘more interested’ in their royal ties than anything. Mr Quinn explained this reasoning by noting, “The American public would have much preferred it if Harry had not given up his royal role — that's all he's ever been trained for and that's the main thing that made him interesting.” But “Now he's lost that, why should anyone in the States be interested,” plus “Meghan hates the idea that she might be pulled down by this.”","entertainment"

"275","Victoria Beckham cutting her losses before 'descendant'","https://www.geo.tv/latest/576219-victoria-beckham-cutting-her-losses-before-descendant","Experts suspect the reason for Victoria Beckham’s separation from Meghan Markle, is to do with the fact that they are in the “descendant, not the ascendant.” Insight into this bid has been shared by royal commentator Ingrid Seward. She made note of the whole thing while speaking toGB News. During that time she explained, “I only think they would reconcile if they come across each other, and I’m not sure that they really do. I can’t think that their paths would particularly cross again.” “I think the Beckhams have distanced themselves from Meghan and Harry, but for the obvious reasons that we all know, you know Meghan and Harry are in the descendant, not the ascendant.” Afterall, “Victoria is actually too busy. She’s got a business. She’s got a very successful husband. She’s got houses all over the place. She’s got children. I don’t think she probably has any time to think about it really.” But in the Sussexes camp, Ms Seward admits that Meghan is “annoyed that Victoria had pipped her to the post” about her Netflix show. “She’d have to be magnanimous about it deep down inside. She might be annoyed, but she cannot show it, and you know she’s enough of an actress to know that she can’t possibly show it.” Before concluding she also warned that no public outburst is to be expected due to this because, “I think to say anything else would be a grave error, and [Meghan] knows that.” “Of course, she’d be annoyed, but there’s absolutely nothing she can do about it because she doesn’t have a hand in the scheduling of these shows.”","entertainment"
