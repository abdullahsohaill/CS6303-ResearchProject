Brent crude futures slipped 26 cents, or 0.35%, to $74.91 a barrel by 0440 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $70.97 a barrel, down 27 cents, or 0.38%. Both contracts last week notched their biggest weekly gains since late September to reach their highest settlement levels since Nov. 7 after Russia fired a hypersonic missile at Ukraine in a warning to the United States and UK following strikes by Kyiv on Russia using U.S. and British weapons. ""Oil prices are starting the new week with some slight cool-off as market participants await more cues from geopolitical developments and the Fed’s policy outlook to set the tone,"" said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG. Also read: Cooking oil and ghee prices see surge in Pakistan ""Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have edged up a notch lately, leading to some pricing for the risks of a wider escalation potentially impacting oil supplies."" As both Ukraine and Russia vie to gain some leverage ahead of any upcoming negotiations under a Trump administration, the tensions may likely persist into the year-end, keeping Brent prices supported around $70-$80, Yeap added. In addition, Iran reacted to a resolution passed by the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Thursday by ordering measures such as activating various new and advanced centrifuges used in enriching uranium. ""The IAEA censure and Iran’s response heightens the likelihood that Trump will look to enforce sanctions against Iran’s oil exports when he comes into power,"" Vivek Dhar, a commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note. Enforced sanctions could sideline about 1 million barrels per day of Iran’s oil exports, about 1% of global oil supply, he said. The Iranian foreign ministry said on Sunday that it will hold talks about its disputed nuclear programme with three European powers on Nov. 29. ""Markets are concerned not only about damage to oil ports and infrastructure, but also the possibility of war contagion and involvement of more countries,"" said Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at Phillip Nova. Investors were also focused on rising crude oil demand at China and India, the world's top and third-largest importers, respectively. China's crude imports rebounded in November as lower prices drew stockpiling demand while Indian refiners increased crude throughput by 3% on year to 5.04 million bpd in October, buoyed by fuel exports. For the week, traders will be eyeing U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data, due on Wednesday, as that will likely inform the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting scheduled for Dec. 17-18, Sachdeva said."

On Friday, the KSE-100 saw a notable gain of 469.84 points, or 0.48%, closing at 97,798.23 points. The index briefly surged to an intraday high of 99,623.03 points, signaling optimism in the market. Analysts have raised their projections, forecasting that the KSE-100 could rally past 120,000 by the end of 2025. This surge is expected to be driven by continued improvements in macroeconomic conditions, including lower bond yields, which are injecting additional liquidity into the equity market. Since January 2024, mutual funds have invested over $132 million in Pakistani stocks, a significant shift following the decline in bond yields. This influx of capital is seen as a positive indicator of investor sentiment. The State Bank of Pakistan's decision to cut interest rates by a cumulative 700 basis points, bringing the rate down to 15% from 22% in May 2024, has further contributed to the market's rally. The broader market, as reflected by the All-Share Index, also displayed healthy gains. It stood at 62,376.87 points, with a net increase of 280.51 points or 0.44%.

Sounds like a dream, right? But is it truly impossible? Given Pakistan’s current economic challenges, the idea might seem far-fetched, but with the right strategies and data-driven insights, could this dream be turned into reality? The PKR overtaking the mighty US Dollar – it’s an interesting topic to think about. In recent years, the value of Pakistani Rupee has been under constant pressure due to factors like inflation, trade imbalances, and external debt. However, strengthening the PKR is something that Pakistan can work towards, even if overtaking the dollar isn't realistic in the immediate future. So, let’s dive into how this might happen and what it would mean for the country. Not to mention, but it requires more than just economic policies — it demands political stability and sound governance. To be blunt, the PKR is far from overtaking the USD anytime soon. Pakistan is currently facing serious economic challenges: inflation is sky-high, foreign reserves are running low, and the dollar rate is over 280. As of November 2024, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves have reached $11.29 billion, the highest in over two and a half years, thanks to a boost from remittances and an IMF payment. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) set a tough tax collection target of Rs 12.9 trillion for 2024-25, but there's been a Rs 190 billion shortfall in the first four months of the fiscal year. The shortfall mainly comes from lower import taxes and slower growth in domestic sales tax, although the collection is up 25% compared to last year. Political instability is one of the biggest obstacles to economic progress in any country, and Pakistan is no exception. Political uncertainty creates a lack of confidence, both domestically and internationally. With frequent changes in government, protests, and uncertainty around major decisions, the Pakistani Rupee has faced significant devaluation over the years. For Pakistan to strengthen its currency, it needs a stable political environment. Without this, economic policies will remain inconsistent, and investor confidence will be hard to gain. So, if we were to aim for PKR to compete with the USD, what steps can Pakistan take? Let’s look at some expert-backed strategies – that would require a multi-faceted approach including: Pakistan’s trade deficit is a major problem. The country imports more than it exports, which means there’s a constant demand for foreign currency. By focusing on producing more locally and reducing dependency on imports, Pakistan can improve its balance of payments and give the PKR a fighting chance. Countries like China and India have done it, so why can’t we? Investing in sectors like IT, textiles, and agriculture can generate foreign exchange. If Pakistan can find ways to make its goods more competitive in the global market, the demand for the rupee will increase as foreign buyers purchase Pakistani products. Policies that support export industries could be key to boosting exports. Unfortunately, Pakistan's current export growth is not sufficient to balance its trade deficit. To attract more dollars into the country, Pakistan needs to create a business-friendly environment (that encourages both domestic and foreign investment). However, foreign investments have been declining due to political instability and security concerns. This means simplifying regulations, protecting investor rights, and ensuring political stability. Sectors like IT, agriculture, and renewable energy have the potential to attract billions in foreign investment. More investment means more capital flowing into the country, which strengthens the currency and boosts economic growth. So, if the government can stabilize the political environment and offer incentives, we might see a boost in foreign investments. With inflation soaring over 30%, the purchasing power of the rupee is eroding fast. If Pakistan can keep inflation under control, the value of the PKR will remain more stable. Inflation is one of the main reasons why the PKR has depreciated in the past, so keeping it in check is crucial. This can be achieved by implementing sound monetary policies, reducing government spending, and controlling the money supply. One of the key factors in strengthening any currency is having a strong economy. If Pakistan can boost industrial growth, improve agriculture, and expand sectors like technology, the economy will grow, which in turn strengthens the currency. Growth leads to higher exports, more jobs, and increased revenue, all of which can help stabilize the rupee. Pakistan has a large amount of external debt, much of it in foreign currency. To reduce the impact of this debt, Pakistan needs to focus on managing its fiscal policy better. This could include reducing government borrowing and ensuring that loans are spent in a way that generates returns for the economy. If, by some miracle, the PKR does overtake the USD, it could have several positive outcomes: A stronger PKR would help reduce the cost of imports, which would ease inflation and make essential goods more affordable. For a population already suffering due to economic hardship, this would be a welcome relief. A stronger PKR means more value for your money. Imagine getting more bang for your buck when shopping or traveling abroad! A stronger rupee would mean cheaper imports, especially essential goods like oil, machinery, and medicines. It means that Pakistani citizens will have more buying power. Pakistan’s debt is largely in dollars. With a stronger PKR, the government would need fewer rupees to pay off dollar-denominated loans, easing the financial strain on the country. A stable currency is a sign of a stable economy. If Pakistan can strengthen the PKR, it would signal to investors that the country’s economy is growing and that the currency is reliable. With a stronger currency, imports might become cheaper, and while exports could become more expensive, Pakistan would have more capital to invest in boosting its export sector. A stable and strong PKR might also attract more foreign investors. People prefer to invest in stable economies, so if the currency is strong and inflation is under control, Pakistan could see a rise in foreign direct investment (FDI). But let’s not get carried away as it's not all sunshine and rainbows. With political parties in constant conflict, leadership changes, and the ongoing power struggle between the government and opposition, finding common ground on economic reforms is challenging. Political instability breeds uncertainty, and economic decisions become difficult to implement when the country is divided. Hence, strengthening the PKR would also come with some downsides: If the PKR becomes too strong, it might encourage rich individuals to move their money abroad. This could get risky, especially with all the political uncertainty making people nervous about keeping their investments here. In the short term, strengthening the PKR might lead to economic discomfort. Price hikes in domestic goods, reduced export revenues, and a slowdown in certain industries could hurt the economy initially. It requires careful policy management to balance these effects. Making the rupee stronger might mean stricter spending rules, which could slow the economy down for a while. This could mean higher unemployment rates and slower development of key sectors like infrastructure. A stronger rupee could make Pakistani exports less competitive, as they would become more expensive for international buyers. This could hurt our exporters, particularly small businesses. If the rupee strengthens without solid economic growth or stability to support it, it’s like building on shaky ground. It might look good at first, but it could lead to an economic bubble that bursts later, causing bigger problems. This kind of situation has happened before in some Latin American countries, where artificially strong currencies ended up crashing and hurting their economies. A stronger rupee could make Pakistani goods more expensive for foreign buyers. This would hurt exporters, who may see a decrease in demand for their products. The government would need to find ways to balance this effect. A stronger PKR might cut down import costs, but it could also push up inflation for a bit. Local businesses might hike prices to adjust to the exchange rate, and that could end up hitting consumers. A stronger PKR could mean higher costs for foreign tourists visiting Pakistan, which might hit the tourism industry hard—a sector with big growth potential for the country. In a nutshell, while it’s tempting to imagine the PKR surpassing the USD, we need to keep our expectations grounded. For that to even be a possibility, Pakistan would need to implement significant economic reforms, stabilize the political environment, and focus on sustainable growth. Strengthening the PKR isn’t out of reach, but it would require careful planning and a long-term vision. Achieving this would mean controlling inflation, boosting exports, and managing debt—all while working to build a more stable economy. Moreover, for the PKR to see meaningful improvement, political stability is key. With the right policies, stronger governance, and concerted efforts from both the government and private sector, Pakistan could gradually move toward a more stable and resilient economy. It won’t happen overnight, but with a united effort focused on economic progress, a stronger PKR—and a more prosperous future — is within reach."

The proposed tariff adjustment, reportedly aimed at aligning with declining global prices of solar panels and batteries, has sparked concerns among renewable energy advocates. Currently, solar system owners are compensated at over Rs21 per unit for the electricity they supply to the national grid. However, the revised rates under consideration range between Rs7.5 and Rs11 per unit, slashing the previous payment by more than half. Under the proposed revisions, the equivalence of electricity exchange would also be altered. Presently, two units of solar-generated electricity are treated as equivalent to one unit of national grid power. If the new rates are implemented, this ratio could increase to six units of solar power for one grid unit. For solar consumers, this would mean selling their surplus electricity at Rs7.5-11 per unit while paying Rs60 per unit for grid electricity consumed during nighttime or peak hours. The revised tariffs are expected to reduce the financial viability of rooftop solar systems, discouraging new installations and potentially slowing down Pakistan's transition toward renewable energy. Advocates of solar energy argue that such a move would deter investment in solar power, which has seen significant growth in recent years due to its cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. The proposed tariff reduction comes in the wake of concerns raised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the rising adoption of solar energy in Pakistan. The IMF has expressed apprehensions that increased solar generation could disrupt the country's existing capacity payment obligations to power producers, a critical component of its energy policy framework. Energy experts warn that the proposed changes could undermine the government’s renewable energy targets. ""This move sends a discouraging message to those looking to invest in clean energy,"" said a renewable energy specialist. ""With increasing electricity prices, solar energy was becoming a viable option for consumers. These adjustments, however, could reverse that trend."""

An uptick in total sales in Spain and Germany, of 7.2% and 6% respectively, offset a contraction in France, Italy, and Britain, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said. European automakers are struggling with weak demand, high production costs, and managing the shift to EVs, while trying to fend off competition from China. The number of new vehicles registered in October in the EU, Britain, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) rose 0.1% year-on-year to 1.04 million. Sales of fully electric cars (BEVs) rose for the second consecutive month, up 6.9% in October, while those of hybrid cars (HEVs) rose by 15.8%. Registrations in the EU, Britain, and EFTA at Volkswagen rose 12.6%, while they fell by 16.7% at Stellantis and by 0.4% at Renault. Sales were down 23.1% at EV maker Tesla and down 10% at China's SAIC Motor. In the EU, total new car registrations rose 1.1% year-on-year. Germany saw sales increase with 6%, after three months of losses. Electrified vehicles - either BEV, HEV or plug-in hybrids (PHEV) - sold in the bloc accounted for 55.4% of passenger car registrations in October, up from 51.3% in the previous year. “As we head towards the end of the year, carmakers are increasingly rolling out discounts and deals to sell off any unsold stock,” said Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at market research firm JATO Dynamics in a separate statement on Wednesday. “This is helping registration figures stabilise and shouldn't be mistaken as an indication of market recovery,"" he added.

CEO Lei Jun said on his social media account that the electronics maker was raising its goal from a previous target to deliver 120,000 of its first EV, the SU7 sedan, as demand surges. This is also far more than an initial goal of 76,000 it set when it launched the SU7 early this year. Xiaomi launched the car, which takes styling cues from Porsche, in March, entering a crowded Chinese EV market with an attention-grabbing price tag - under $30,000 for the base model, $4,000 cheaper than that of Tesla's Model 3 in China. EV and plug-in hybrid sales in China have grown to account for over half of overall sales in the world's largest auto maker. In October they grew by 56.7% from the prior year, marking the fourth consecutive month battery-powered autos including plug-ins outsold gasoline cars in the country. To keep up with demand, Xiaomi has doubled production shifts since June and launched the premium SU7 Ultra model priced at more than $110,000. Xiaomi's President Lu Weibing told a post-earnings call that its factory now had the capacity to make 20,000 cars each month and that he still saw scope for that to grow. ""Our investment is still very substantial and we continue to improve our hardware and software. And basically it doesn't matter what the ultimate delivery level is, we are still investing very heavily. We are working on R&D (research and development) for new models,"" he said. One of the areas Xiaomi was working on was developing autonomous driving technology, he added. Revenue was 92.5 billion yuan ($12.77 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating an LSEG consensus estimate from 15 analysts of 91.1 billion yuan. Huatai Securities has forecast Xiaomi will deliver 400,000 EVs in 2025 when electric cars will grow to account for roughly a fifth of revenue compared with 8% for this year. Xiaomi's auto business though is still operating at a loss. The unit reported an adjusted loss of 1.5 billion yuan for the quarter, with a gross profit margin of 17.1%. During the quarter, Xiaomi maintained its position as the world's third-largest smartphone maker with shipments of 42.8 million units, up 3% and capturing 14% of the market, according to research firm Canalys. Lu said the company planned to increase the number of offline retail stores in mainland China from 13,000 to 15,000 by the end of the year and 20,000 to next year, and was investing heavily in technology to grow its market share.

The stock gained 29% this week, adding more than $230 billion in market capitalization, its best since January 2023. ""Tesla and CEO Elon Musk are perhaps the biggest winners from the election result, and we believe Trump's victory will help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology,"" said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. The billionaire could push for favorable regulation of autonomous vehicles that Tesla plans and also get the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to hold off on potential enforcement actions involving the safety of Tesla's current driver-assistance systems, a source had told Reuters. Musk has focused on self-driving vehicle technology, ditching plans to build an economy car priced at under $30,000. However, development and regulatory hurdles have delayed the commercialization of such technologies. ""If Musk can convince Trump to establish federal autonomous vehicle rules, we think that's a good thing for the auto industry because we think firms want one set of rules rather than each state making their own,"" said David Whiston, equity strategist at Morningstar.

Trump has said he plans to begin rescinding Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department vehicle rules on his first day in office and is considering paring back or eliminating EV tax breaks and other incentives. Those regulatory changes could give automakers more flexibility to build more profitable gas-powered SUVs and trucks but raise questions about the future of billions of dollars in EV battery and manufacturing spending. The Zero Emission Transportation Association, which includes Tesla, Rivian, Lucid and battery maker LG, said on Wednesday it was ready to work with Trump. The ""next four years are critical to ensuring that these technologies are developed and deployed by American workers in American factories for generations,"" it added. Tesla shares closed nearly 15% higher on Wednesday as investors bet it stood to benefit from its CEO Elon Musk's close ties with Trump. The American Trucking Associations on Wednesday called on Trump to replace the EPA's tighter tailpipe emissions with national emission standards that were ""technologically achievable and account for the operational realities of our essential industry."" Trump plans to rescind California's ability to set its own vehicle emissions rules, as he did in 2019. President Joe Biden reinstated California's authority. Trump will also decide how to spend billions of dollars in EV charging grants. Trump has repeatedly warned he will impose tariffs of 200% or more on vehicles imported from Mexico and could also impose them on Asian and European vehicles. Trump wants to prevent Chinese auto imports, but is open to Chinese automakers building vehicles in the United States. ""We're going to give incentives, and if China and other countries want to come here and sell the cars, they're going to build plants here, and they're going to hire our workers,"" Trump told Reuters in August. Mark Williams, president of site selection firm Strategic Development Group, expects to see greater demand for his company, but said tariffs will likely result in higher costs. ""If you're going to cut China out of our manufacturing system of pieces and parts that feed into automakers and you don't have a Mexico or somewhere else, I just don't know how much of it you can do in the U.S.,"" he said. ""I think we need Mexico more than ever if China is getting cut off."" South Korea's trade minister said Wednesday he expected companies from his country to invest more in the United States if Trump imposes higher tariffs. Honda's production capacity in Mexico is about 200,000 vehicles annually and 80% are exported to the U.S. market, chief operating officer Shinji Aoyama said. If the US were to impose permanent tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico, Aoyama said Honda would have to think about shifting production. Toyota builds Tacoma trucks at two plants in Mexico and sold more than 230,000 of the model in the United States last year. A person close to Toyota said steep tariffs by Trump on Mexican imports could prompt the automaker to move production of a vehicle like the Tacoma to San Antonio, Texas. A Toyota spokesperson declined to comment."

Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network. “Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses. Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous. His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?” Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.” The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles. Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story. On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10. Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade. An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals. As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively. Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490. In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas. Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s. “It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.” After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day. Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention. The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage. Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability. “It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”"

Brent crude futures slipped 26 cents, or 0.35%, to $74.91 a barrel by 0440 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $70.97 a barrel, down 27 cents, or 0.38%. Both contracts last week notched their biggest weekly gains since late September to reach their highest settlement levels since Nov. 7 after Russia fired a hypersonic missile at Ukraine in a warning to the United States and UK following strikes by Kyiv on Russia using U.S. and British weapons. ""Oil prices are starting the new week with some slight cool-off as market participants await more cues from geopolitical developments and the Fed’s policy outlook to set the tone,"" said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG. Also read: Cooking oil and ghee prices see surge in Pakistan ""Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have edged up a notch lately, leading to some pricing for the risks of a wider escalation potentially impacting oil supplies."" As both Ukraine and Russia vie to gain some leverage ahead of any upcoming negotiations under a Trump administration, the tensions may likely persist into the year-end, keeping Brent prices supported around $70-$80, Yeap added. In addition, Iran reacted to a resolution passed by the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Thursday by ordering measures such as activating various new and advanced centrifuges used in enriching uranium. ""The IAEA censure and Iran’s response heightens the likelihood that Trump will look to enforce sanctions against Iran’s oil exports when he comes into power,"" Vivek Dhar, a commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note. Enforced sanctions could sideline about 1 million barrels per day of Iran’s oil exports, about 1% of global oil supply, he said. The Iranian foreign ministry said on Sunday that it will hold talks about its disputed nuclear programme with three European powers on Nov. 29. ""Markets are concerned not only about damage to oil ports and infrastructure, but also the possibility of war contagion and involvement of more countries,"" said Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at Phillip Nova. Investors were also focused on rising crude oil demand at China and India, the world's top and third-largest importers, respectively. China's crude imports rebounded in November as lower prices drew stockpiling demand while Indian refiners increased crude throughput by 3% on year to 5.04 million bpd in October, buoyed by fuel exports. For the week, traders will be eyeing U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data, due on Wednesday, as that will likely inform the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting scheduled for Dec. 17-18, Sachdeva said."

Topline Research predicts that the inflation rate for the current month will likely range between 4.5% and 5%. It predicts that inflation rate will fall below 5% after 78 months.

Sounds like a dream, right? But is it truly impossible? Given Pakistan’s current economic challenges, the idea might seem far-fetched, but with the right strategies and data-driven insights, could this dream be turned into reality? The PKR overtaking the mighty US Dollar – it’s an interesting topic to think about. In recent years, the value of Pakistani Rupee has been under constant pressure due to factors like inflation, trade imbalances, and external debt. However, strengthening the PKR is something that Pakistan can work towards, even if overtaking the dollar isn't realistic in the immediate future. So, let’s dive into how this might happen and what it would mean for the country. Not to mention, but it requires more than just economic policies — it demands political stability and sound governance. To be blunt, the PKR is far from overtaking the USD anytime soon. Pakistan is currently facing serious economic challenges: inflation is sky-high, foreign reserves are running low, and the dollar rate is over 280. As of November 2024, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves have reached $11.29 billion, the highest in over two and a half years, thanks to a boost from remittances and an IMF payment. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) set a tough tax collection target of Rs 12.9 trillion for 2024-25, but there's been a Rs 190 billion shortfall in the first four months of the fiscal year. The shortfall mainly comes from lower import taxes and slower growth in domestic sales tax, although the collection is up 25% compared to last year. Political instability is one of the biggest obstacles to economic progress in any country, and Pakistan is no exception. Political uncertainty creates a lack of confidence, both domestically and internationally. With frequent changes in government, protests, and uncertainty around major decisions, the Pakistani Rupee has faced significant devaluation over the years. For Pakistan to strengthen its currency, it needs a stable political environment. Without this, economic policies will remain inconsistent, and investor confidence will be hard to gain. So, if we were to aim for PKR to compete with the USD, what steps can Pakistan take? Let’s look at some expert-backed strategies – that would require a multi-faceted approach including: Pakistan’s trade deficit is a major problem. The country imports more than it exports, which means there’s a constant demand for foreign currency. By focusing on producing more locally and reducing dependency on imports, Pakistan can improve its balance of payments and give the PKR a fighting chance. Countries like China and India have done it, so why can’t we? Investing in sectors like IT, textiles, and agriculture can generate foreign exchange. If Pakistan can find ways to make its goods more competitive in the global market, the demand for the rupee will increase as foreign buyers purchase Pakistani products. Policies that support export industries could be key to boosting exports. Unfortunately, Pakistan's current export growth is not sufficient to balance its trade deficit. To attract more dollars into the country, Pakistan needs to create a business-friendly environment (that encourages both domestic and foreign investment). However, foreign investments have been declining due to political instability and security concerns. This means simplifying regulations, protecting investor rights, and ensuring political stability. Sectors like IT, agriculture, and renewable energy have the potential to attract billions in foreign investment. More investment means more capital flowing into the country, which strengthens the currency and boosts economic growth. So, if the government can stabilize the political environment and offer incentives, we might see a boost in foreign investments. With inflation soaring over 30%, the purchasing power of the rupee is eroding fast. If Pakistan can keep inflation under control, the value of the PKR will remain more stable. Inflation is one of the main reasons why the PKR has depreciated in the past, so keeping it in check is crucial. This can be achieved by implementing sound monetary policies, reducing government spending, and controlling the money supply. One of the key factors in strengthening any currency is having a strong economy. If Pakistan can boost industrial growth, improve agriculture, and expand sectors like technology, the economy will grow, which in turn strengthens the currency. Growth leads to higher exports, more jobs, and increased revenue, all of which can help stabilize the rupee. Pakistan has a large amount of external debt, much of it in foreign currency. To reduce the impact of this debt, Pakistan needs to focus on managing its fiscal policy better. This could include reducing government borrowing and ensuring that loans are spent in a way that generates returns for the economy. If, by some miracle, the PKR does overtake the USD, it could have several positive outcomes: A stronger PKR would help reduce the cost of imports, which would ease inflation and make essential goods more affordable. For a population already suffering due to economic hardship, this would be a welcome relief. A stronger PKR means more value for your money. Imagine getting more bang for your buck when shopping or traveling abroad! A stronger rupee would mean cheaper imports, especially essential goods like oil, machinery, and medicines. It means that Pakistani citizens will have more buying power. Pakistan’s debt is largely in dollars. With a stronger PKR, the government would need fewer rupees to pay off dollar-denominated loans, easing the financial strain on the country. A stable currency is a sign of a stable economy. If Pakistan can strengthen the PKR, it would signal to investors that the country’s economy is growing and that the currency is reliable. With a stronger currency, imports might become cheaper, and while exports could become more expensive, Pakistan would have more capital to invest in boosting its export sector. A stable and strong PKR might also attract more foreign investors. People prefer to invest in stable economies, so if the currency is strong and inflation is under control, Pakistan could see a rise in foreign direct investment (FDI). But let’s not get carried away as it's not all sunshine and rainbows. With political parties in constant conflict, leadership changes, and the ongoing power struggle between the government and opposition, finding common ground on economic reforms is challenging. Political instability breeds uncertainty, and economic decisions become difficult to implement when the country is divided. Hence, strengthening the PKR would also come with some downsides: If the PKR becomes too strong, it might encourage rich individuals to move their money abroad. This could get risky, especially with all the political uncertainty making people nervous about keeping their investments here. In the short term, strengthening the PKR might lead to economic discomfort. Price hikes in domestic goods, reduced export revenues, and a slowdown in certain industries could hurt the economy initially. It requires careful policy management to balance these effects. Making the rupee stronger might mean stricter spending rules, which could slow the economy down for a while. This could mean higher unemployment rates and slower development of key sectors like infrastructure. A stronger rupee could make Pakistani exports less competitive, as they would become more expensive for international buyers. This could hurt our exporters, particularly small businesses. If the rupee strengthens without solid economic growth or stability to support it, it’s like building on shaky ground. It might look good at first, but it could lead to an economic bubble that bursts later, causing bigger problems. This kind of situation has happened before in some Latin American countries, where artificially strong currencies ended up crashing and hurting their economies. A stronger rupee could make Pakistani goods more expensive for foreign buyers. This would hurt exporters, who may see a decrease in demand for their products. The government would need to find ways to balance this effect. A stronger PKR might cut down import costs, but it could also push up inflation for a bit. Local businesses might hike prices to adjust to the exchange rate, and that could end up hitting consumers. A stronger PKR could mean higher costs for foreign tourists visiting Pakistan, which might hit the tourism industry hard—a sector with big growth potential for the country. In a nutshell, while it’s tempting to imagine the PKR surpassing the USD, we need to keep our expectations grounded. For that to even be a possibility, Pakistan would need to implement significant economic reforms, stabilize the political environment, and focus on sustainable growth. Strengthening the PKR isn’t out of reach, but it would require careful planning and a long-term vision. Achieving this would mean controlling inflation, boosting exports, and managing debt—all while working to build a more stable economy. Moreover, for the PKR to see meaningful improvement, political stability is key. With the right policies, stronger governance, and concerted efforts from both the government and private sector, Pakistan could gradually move toward a more stable and resilient economy. It won’t happen overnight, but with a united effort focused on economic progress, a stronger PKR—and a more prosperous future — is within reach."

Automakers and technology companies are investing in autonomous ride-hailing services to capitalize on the technology to drive commercial success, even as it faces widespread skepticism and tight regulatory scrutiny. The investment round also saw participation from existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price, Waymo said. ""With this latest investment, we will continue to welcome more riders into our Waymo One ride-hailing service in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and in Austin and Atlanta through our expanded partnership with Uber,"" the company said. Alphabet had planned a $5 billion investment in Waymo over a multi-year period, finance chief Ruth Porat said in July. Waymo, which offers paid rides in autonomous vehicles in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, as well as in Phoenix, Arizona, spent years logging millions of miles of testing before it received its first permit in 2022 from the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates ride-hailing services. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the electric vehicle maker will roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year. General Motors' Cruise is testing cars with human safety drivers after an accident last year led it to pull all vehicles from the road. Meanwhile, Amazon's Zoox is expanding testing for its vehicles built without steering wheels and pedals."

Sales in the world's biggest auto market hit 2.13 million vehicles in September, up from 2.04 million a year earlier. For the first nine months of the year, sales were up 1.9% from 2023 levels, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). Sales of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids jumped 50.9% and accounted for 52.8% of overall sales. It was the third month in a row that battery-powered vehicles including plug-ins outnumbered sales of gasoline cars in China. Sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids - a category the Chinese industry group classifies as ""new energy vehicles"" - hit 1.12 million in September in China and 7.13 million in the first nine months of the year. Global EV sales have slowed this year with automakers outside China scaling back production plans. Sales in China, however, have risen, driven by an expanded package of national subsidies for consumers trading in older vehicles for EVs and more fuel-efficient cars - a programme likened to the U.S. ""cash-for-clunkers"" stimulus in 2009. Tesla sold over 72,000 vehicles in China's domestic market, up 66% year-on-year, its best month this year. The company has already announced quarterly global deliveries. Tesla, which counts on China for about a third of its sales, has added its own incentives, including zero-percent financing in the market. Chinese EV makers BYD, Li Auto and Xpeng recorded their best-ever month in September. China's best-selling new energy vehicle makers through the first eight months were BYD, Geely and Tesla. China's government announced in July a subsidy of more than $2,800 when consumers scrap an older car to replace it with an EV. The subsidy for a more fuel-efficient combustion vehicle is just over $2,100. As of late September, 1.1 million consumers had registered to take advantage of the subsidies. Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the CPCA, said on Saturday that he expects a strong fourth quarter on trade-in subsidies by local governments. The government will ""significantly increase"" debt issuance to boost the world's second-largest economy, Finance Minister Lan Foan said on Saturday, as it seeks to lift faltering growth back towards its target of around 5%. China's central bank has announced interest rate cuts and liquidity injections in its largest easing since the COVID-19 pandemic. An open question is whether China will channel more stimulus to support purchase of EVs, a sector officials have identified as a priority. The finance ministry plans to issue 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) of special sovereign debt, using part of the proceeds to increase subsidies for the consumer goods trade-in programme and for business equipment upgrades, Reuters has reported. China's car exports grew 22% in September to 3.55 million vehicles over the first nine months of the year, growth that has coinciding with a backlash for Chinese car makers in major overseas markets. China overtook Japan to become the world's largest vehicle exporter last year. U.S. officials and others have argued China's capacity to make more cars than it can sell at home combined with past subsidies give Chinese EV makers an unfair advantage. The European Union is pressing ahead with tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese-made EVs after a vote last week, a move opposed by Germany. China has said it hopes to avoid tariffs through negotiations that would set minimum EV sales prices in Europe. The United States and Canada have each set tariffs of 100% on Chinese-made EVs that effectively lock them out of those markets."

According to a report by Gulf News, individuals working in the drone industry in the UAE can earn over 30,000 AED (approximately Rs2.2 million) per month. The demand for tech experts is soaring in various sectors, with drone operators earning between 4,800 AED to 13,700 AED per month. Engineers in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field can earn between 22,000 AED and 25,000 AED, while those with advanced skills in engineering and artificial intelligence are making even more, exceeding 25,000 AED. Economic Research Institutes suggest that by adding a touch of artificial intelligence expertise, employees in this field can potentially earn above 30,000 AED per month. The UAV industry in the UAE is on the rise, and companies are embracing the potential of drone technologies. The UAE's UAV sector is valued at approximately 1.1 billion dollars, with its local Dubai Silicon Oasis hub serving as a manufacturing hub for drones, which was inaugurated in 2022.

This figure signifies an alarming 87.7% year-on-year (YoY) reduction from the $55 million reported during the corresponding period in the previous year. This downturn has led to a drastic contraction, with the cumulative figure for the first nine months of 2023 (9MCY23) plunging by nearly 90% to a paltry $35.1 million. While there is a slight glimmer of hope in the form of a 30.8% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase, with funding rising from $5.2 million in Q2, the overall landscape remains challenging. The deal count also paints a sobering picture, with just five deals recorded during Q3, reflecting a 50% YoY decline and a 37.5% QoQ dip. In fact, the total number of deals for 9MCY23 stands at a meager 21, a figure roughly equivalent to what was recorded in Q1 of 2022 alone. One of the most telling indicators of the industry's current state is the significant drop in the average ticket size, which has plummeted by 70.5% YoY to $1.36 million in Q3-2023, down from $4.26 million. Although there has been a slight uptick from the previous quarter's $742,900, the decline remains substantial. Breaking it down by rounds, the seed stage has emerged as the most dominant, with five startups securing seed funding during Q3. In 9MCY23, seed funding has accounted for the majority, representing 15 out of the 21 transactions. Notably, Taleemabad in the edtech sector secured the lion's share of seed funding, amassing $2.6 million during the quarter. In terms of sectors, fintech has emerged as the leader both in dollar amount, raking in $14 million, and the number of transactions, with a total of seven deals. Transportation and logistics come in second, securing $11.1 million across four transactions. Among the investors, Indus Valley Capital stands out by completing two deals in the quarter, while Sarmayacar concluded one. On the other hand, Zayn VC, i2i Ventures, and Fatima Gobi did not publicly disclose any investments in Q3-2023, with each revealing only one investment in 9M2023. This could potentially indicate that local venture capital firms are deploying funds without making formal announcements. On a global scale, venture capital investment experienced a significant dip, amounting to $60.5 billion in Q2-2023, reaching the lowest levels seen since the first quarter of 2018, pre-COVID. Notably, the third quarter also witnessed the closure of Medznmore, one of the highest-funded startups, and Jugnu halted its core business operations shortly after.According to the Carta database, this year has seen a notable increase in the closure of startups, signaling the challenges faced by the ecosystem. In light of these developments, it is worth noting that some sectors, such as banking and the energy industry, have managed to perform relatively well, leveraging Pakistan's structural imbalances. However, the overall funding landscape for startups in Pakistan presents a formidable obstacle, necessitating a strategic reevaluation of the ecosystem's growth trajectory."
"84","Business","How Pakistani organizations can benefit from salary transparency in job postings?","https://www.samaa.tv/2087390-how-pakistani-organizations-can-benefit-from-salary-transparency-in-job-postings","The recent LinkedIn data highlights the growing trend of salary transparency in the job market, with 91% of jobseekers in the US stating that they are more likely to apply for a position if the job posting includes the salary range. This trend is not unique to the US, as California and Washington have joined the growing list of states and municipalities that require employers to include salary ranges in job listings. In Pakistan, however, the trend of salary transparency is not as widespread as in other parts of the world. It is not uncommon for job postings in Pakistan to omit the salary range, leaving jobseekers unsure of what they can expect in terms of compensation. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for job hunters to assess their options and negotiate a fair salary. One reason for the lack of salary transparency in Pakistan may be the prevailing culture of secrecy surrounding salary information. Discussing one’s salary is often considered taboo in Pakistan, and employees may be hesitant to share their compensation information with others. This can make it challenging for businesses to implement a transparent salary policy, as employees may be reluctant to disclose their salary information. However, there are some companies in Pakistan that are leading the way in promoting salary transparency. For example, some companies have started to include the salary range in their job postings, and some are even publishing their pay scales online. This can help create a more level playing field and promote pay equity within the organization. Embracing salary transparency in job postings can provide several benefits to organizations in Pakistan. First and foremost, including a salary range in job postings can help attract more qualified candidates who prioritize pay transparency. By clearly communicating the salary range, organizations can also improve candidate impressions of the company and establish trust from the outset of the recruitment process. Additionally, by promoting pay equity, organizations can ensure a more diverse and inclusive workplace, which has been linked to improved productivity and profitability. Finally, by complying with local laws and regulations regarding pay transparency; organizations can avoid legal complications and maintain a positive reputation in the market. Overall, implementing salary transparency in job postings can be a smart strategy for organizations in Pakistan looking to optimize their talent acquisition and promote a more equitable and productive workplace."

Brent crude futures were down 30 cents, or 0.41%, at $72.26 a barrel by 0105 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 25 cents, or 0.36%, at $68.45. For the week, Brent is set to fall about 2.2% while WTI is set to decline 2.7%. US crude inventories last week rose by 2.1 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday, much more than analysts' expectations for a 750,000-barrel rise. Meanwhile, gasoline stocks fell by 4.4 million barrels last week to the lowest since November 2022, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 600,000-barrel build. ​Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, also fell unexpectedly by 1.4 million barrels, the data showed. Signs of stronger demand supported oil prices, ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said. ""However, prices came under pressure after the market was reminded of the bleak outlook for demand."" The International Energy Agency forecast global oil supply will exceed demand in 2025 even if cuts remain in place from OPEC+, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, as rising production from the U.S. and other outside producers outpaces sluggish demand. The Paris-based agency raised its 2024 demand growth forecast by 60,000 barrels per day to 920,000 bpd, and left its 2025 oil demand growth forecast little changed at 990,000 bpd. OPEC this week cut its forecast for global oil demand growth for this year and 2025, highlighting weakness in China, India and other regions, marking the producer group's fourth-consecutive downward revision to its 2024 outlook. Also pressuring oil prices, the dollar surged on Thursday to a one-year high and headed for a fifth-straight daily gain fuelled by higher yields and Donald Trump's presidential election victory in the United States. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, which can reduce demand."

According to industry sources, petrol prices are suggested to rise by Rs2.60 per liter, while high-speed diesel (HSD) may see an increase of Rs6 per liter. The price adjustments are proposed based on the current tax rates, with exchange rate effects reportedly kept zero in these calculations. The proposed price hikes include a Rs6 increase per liter for light diesel and Rs5 per liter for kerosene. The current petroleum levy stands at Rs60 per liter on petrol and diesel. Additionally, the ex-refinery rates for petrol and diesel have reportedly climbed by Rs2.58 and Rs6.20, respectively, with the premium per barrel increasing by $1. The oil price adjustments summary will be submitted to the government on November 15, following which the Ministry of Finance will make a final decision. The ministry, with approval from the prime minister, holds authority to amend prices and adjust taxes keeping in mind its revenue targets. As of now, the transportation costs for petrol and diesel are estimated at Rs7.89 and Rs4.17 per liter, respectively. If approved, the expected increase could impact consumers amid rising costs across essential commodities. The IMF has proposed imposing a General Sales Tax (GST) on petroleum products and increasing the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) from Rs60 to Rs70 per litre.

According to details, from July to October, the food exports reached a total value of $2.36 billion, up $420 million compared to the same period last year. The surge is primarily driven by rice, sugar, and vegetable exports, marking consistent growth for the fourth consecutive month. – Rice Exports – Pakistan’s rice exports surged by an impressive 52.53%, exceeding $1 billion during the four-month period. This includes $330 million worth of premium-quality Basmati rice, reflecting increased international demand. – Sugar Exports – Sugar exports soared by a staggering 413%, generating $108.2 million in revenue. – Vegetables and Fruits – Vegetable exports grew by 37% to $91.1 million, while fruit exports rose by 7%, reaching $116.6 million. – Meat and Meat Products – Meat exports recorded a modest 5% increase, totaling over $160 million. However, the report noted declines in the exports of fish, pulses, spices, oilseeds, and dry fruits. In October 2024, the food exports reached $748.4 million, reflecting a 12.77% year-on-year growth. The consistent rise in exports highlights the growing demand for Pakistani agricultural products globally. This growth is expected to boost Pakistan's economy by diversifying its export portfolio and capitalising on its agricultural strengths."

The report highlights that 60% of Pakistan's budget revenue is being spent on interest payments on loans, with government debt rising significantly. This has placed the country in a precarious financial position, the report stated, requiring strict budget control in the coming years. The IMF noted that better fiscal discipline will remain a significant challenge while maintaining necessary social and development expenditures. The report also identified external financial pressures, unusual floods, and wrong policy decisions as major contributors to Pakistan's current economic challenges. The IMF proposed several measures to enhance Pakistan's budgeting processes and financial stability. The report recommends aligning the structure of the Finance Ministry with international best practices. Capacity building and reorganisation of the ministry were needed as essential steps for effective budgeting, it added. Stressing the importance of fiscal discipline, the IMF report urged Pakistan to adhere to the Supreme Court's 2013 decision on supplementary grants. The supplementary budget should be scrutinised according to the 2013 verdict, it added. It advised prior approval from the National Assembly for significant financial decisions, as well as amendments to relevant laws and regulations to improve transparency and accountability. The report stressed the need for a comprehensive digitalisation master plan, adding that it is difficult to transition from a primary fiscal deficit to a primary surplus, emphasizing the importance of credible budget presentations and their effective implementation. The report underscored that the establishment of strong financial institutions can ensure more credible budgeting practices.

"100","Business","Why your grocery bill keeps rising - 16 years of inflation in Pakistan","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324025-why-your-grocery-bill-keeps-rising-16-years-of-inflation-in-pakistan","Over the past 16 years, inflation in Pakistan has silently drained household budgets, adding a significant burden to the average grocery bill. Despite government assurances of 'controlled inflation,' everyday essentials tell a different story. Here's a detailed breakdown, backed by data from 2008 to 2024. Inflation in Pakistan has always been a hot topic, impacting every aspect of daily life. Whether it's your grocery bill or the price of essentials, everything seems to be getting more expensive. Higher inflation means the cost of living goes up, and our money doesn’t stretch as far as it used to. While official reports might suggest that inflation is under control, the reality on the ground indicates otherwise. The persistent rise in food and utility prices continues to strain the average Pakistani household, making it harder to manage daily expenses. The latest trade summary from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reveals that in December 2023, the country experienced a trade deficit of approximately PKR 517.9 billion (around USD 1.83 billion). Exports amounted to PKR 799.6 billion (USD 2.82 billion), showing an increase compared to the previous month. However, imports were significantly higher at PKR 1,317.5 billion (USD 4.65 billion). For the July-December 2023 period, Pakistan's cumulative exports were valued at PKR 4.3 trillion, whereas imports stood at PKR 7.5 trillion, maintaining a notable trade deficit. This imbalance reflects ongoing economic pressures, exacerbated by fluctuating exchange rates and rising global commodity prices. The depreciation of the Pakistani Rupee against the US Dollar has further inflated import costs, impacting the country’s already strained foreign exchange reserves. In the meantime, the government's recent measures to stabilize the Pakistani Rupee and reduce fuel costs have had only a marginal effect on overall inflation. Moving forward, there is an urgent need for targeted economic policies to address the urban-rural divide and reduce food prices, which continue to squeeze household budgets. The period from 2008 to 2012 was marked by severe inflation. In the fiscal year 2008-09, inflation reached a staggering 12.35% in July. This increase was driven by multiple factors, including skyrocketing global fuel prices, which trickled down to almost everything else. The prices of basic food items like wheat, sugar, and cooking oil surged by over 20% in some cases. One of the biggest drivers of inflation over the years has been food. Remember those times when tomatoes or onions suddenly became luxury items? That’s food inflation at work. For example, food prices in urban areas jumped by 3.12% in just one month (August 2019). This was not just a one-off event. It highlights a pattern where food prices keep spiking due to poor harvests, supply chain issues, and import challenges. By 2022, the prices of staples like flour, cooking oil, and sugar had surged by 20-30% within six months. As of September 2024, food inflation stands at 11.5% nationwide, with urban areas feeling the most pressure. Despite government efforts like subsidies, Year-on-Year (YoY) inflation for food items remained above 10% throughout 2023. Rural areas saw a slightly lower rate of around 8.5%, highlighting the varying impact across regions. But it’s not just about food. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has also been rising. This indicates that even non-food items, like clothing and household goods, are becoming more expensive. Your grocery bill feels higher even when official food inflation is technically low. According to RTI data: Even with government interventions like subsidies, YoY inflation for food items remained above 10% in urban regions throughout 2023, pushing household budgets to their limits. From 2019 to 2024, inflation has shown clear disparities between urban and rural areas. Official data indicates that people living in cities have been hit harder than those in villages. It means, if you live in a city, you’re probably paying more for the same items than someone in a rural area. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data highlights a noticeable disparity between urban and rural inflation rates. In July 2019, the national Month-on-Month (MoM) inflation rate was 1.83%, with urban areas consistently facing higher inflation than rural regions. For instance, urban inflation rose to 8.47% in July 2019, compared to 6.92% in rural areas. By August 2023, the urban inflation rate further climbed to 12.9%, driven by rising utility costs and fuel prices. In comparison, rural inflation was recorded at 10.5%, reflecting the relative insulation of rural areas from certain economic pressures. Cities usually have a higher cost of living, so when inflation rises, it’s like a double burden for urban households. As of September 2024, the inflation rate for food items alone stands at 11.5%, with essentials like rice and vegetables contributing the most. Hence, the persistent rise in prices not only strains household budgets but also threatens the nation's economic stability. Urgent reforms in trade policies, subsidies, and agricultural support are needed to ease the burden on Pakistani families. To encapsulate the impact of inflation on the lives of everyday Pakistanis, I'll conclude with a fitting quote: ""Inflation is the silent thief that robs people of their savings, their dreams, and their futures."" — Viktor Chernomyrdin  This article uses data obtained via RTI (Right to Information) from various government departments to provide a comprehensive analysis of inflation trends in Pakistan from 2008 to 2024."

Property investment in China fell 10.3% in the first 10 months of 2024 from a year earlier, after a drop of 10.1% over January to September, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday. Property sales by floor area in the January to October period fell 15.8% from a year earlier, slower than a drop of 17.1% in January-September. China's property sector has been a significant drag on the economy since 2021, when authorities imposed tough measures to curb excessive leverage, which led to heavily indebted developers, stalled housing projects, and mortgage boycotts. Government policies to revitalise the market since last year include lower borrowing costs and greater financing for struggling developers, but a meaningful recovery has yet to emerge, despite these efforts. Most recently, China unveiled tax incentives for home and land deals to boost demand and alleviate financial pressures on developers, in the bid to revive the sector. New construction starts measured by floor area declined 22.6% on year, after a drop of 22.2% in the first nine months.

Malik spoke during a roundtable on FBR’s Track and Trace System (TTS) compliance, where he shared that the prime minister has tasked the FBR with reducing income tax on the salaried class. Achieving this goal relies heavily on controlling the estimated Rs300-350 billion lost to illicit trade in the tobacco sector. The event, hosted by the Institute of Public Opinion and Research (IPOR) in partnership with PILDAT, brought together government representatives, industry stakeholders, policy experts, and media to review IPOR’s latest study findings on compliance within the sector. Malik, who chaired the session, reaffirmed the government’s commitment to enhancing compliance across all sectors through stricter regulations, highlighting that a stable economy requires collaborative efforts from all areas. He also underscored the importance of digitalisation and integrating technology to streamline processes and promote economic stability. Since the TTS implementation began in 2021 for sectors like tobacco, cement, fertiliser, and sugar, the FBR has mandated TTS stamps on all cigarette packs, but full compliance remains challenging. IPOR’s study, conducted in 11 cities across Punjab and Sindh, reviewed compliance at 720 retail outlets across 18 markets. The findings indicated that of 264 cigarette brands surveyed, only 19 were fully compliant with TTS requirements. Non-compliant brands comprised 58% of the market, including both locally manufactured duty-not-paid (65%) and smuggled brands (35%), many of which lacked TTS stamps or violated minimum pricing and health warning requirements. Additionally, 197 brands were found selling below the Minimum Legal Price (MLP), while 48 non-compliant brands sold above it. The roundtable facilitated discussions on TTS enforcement challenges at the retail level, tax implications of non-compliance, and public health impacts. Muhammad Zaheer Qureshi, FBR’s project director for TTS, outlined enforcement progress and discussed challenges like industry compliance and technological adaptation. He also described FBR’s efforts to address these issues through tighter regulatory oversight. The session closed with recommendations to enhance retail enforcement, raise penalties for violations, and launch public awareness campaigns, helping consumers understand the importance of buying compliant products."

Brent crude futures were down 30 cents, or 0.41%, at $72.26 a barrel by 0105 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 25 cents, or 0.36%, at $68.45. For the week, Brent is set to fall about 2.2% while WTI is set to decline 2.7%. US crude inventories last week rose by 2.1 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday, much more than analysts' expectations for a 750,000-barrel rise. Meanwhile, gasoline stocks fell by 4.4 million barrels last week to the lowest since November 2022, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 600,000-barrel build. ​Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, also fell unexpectedly by 1.4 million barrels, the data showed. Signs of stronger demand supported oil prices, ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said. ""However, prices came under pressure after the market was reminded of the bleak outlook for demand."" The International Energy Agency forecast global oil supply will exceed demand in 2025 even if cuts remain in place from OPEC+, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, as rising production from the U.S. and other outside producers outpaces sluggish demand. The Paris-based agency raised its 2024 demand growth forecast by 60,000 barrels per day to 920,000 bpd, and left its 2025 oil demand growth forecast little changed at 990,000 bpd. OPEC this week cut its forecast for global oil demand growth for this year and 2025, highlighting weakness in China, India and other regions, marking the producer group's fourth-consecutive downward revision to its 2024 outlook. Also pressuring oil prices, the dollar surged on Thursday to a one-year high and headed for a fifth-straight daily gain fuelled by higher yields and Donald Trump's presidential election victory in the United States. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, which can reduce demand."

Asian shares looked to end a brutal week on a steadier note, helped by Chinese data retail sales in the world's second-biggest economy beat forecasts in October in a welcome sign for consumer spending, although other indicators missed. Overnight, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there was no need to rush rate cuts with the economy still growing, the job market solid and inflation still above the 2% target, tempering expectations for a rate cut next month. Fed fund futures for next year slumped with December off 7 ticks and imply just 71 basis points of rate cuts by end-2025. A rate cut next month is no longer a high probability event, with just 61% priced in, down from 82.5% in the prior session. That lifted the dollar across the board, especially against the euro as expectations for more aggressive policy easing in Europe further undermined the single currency already trading at one-year lows. Goldman Sachs now sees a greater risk that the Fed could slow the pace of easing sooner, possibly as soon as the December or January meetings, while JPMorgan still tips the Fed to cut in December though they expect the central bank could dial down the easing pace in January. ""After the sugar hit of Trump’s election and its subsequent impacts on expectations for company profits, the market’s enthusiasm is being watered-down by greater interest rate uncertainty, especially going into next year,"" said Kyle Rodda, a senior analyst at Capital.com. On Friday, Nasdaq futures fell 0.4% while S&P 500 futures eased 0.3%. EUROSTOXX 50 futures fell 0.5%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2% but was still down 4.3% for the week, the biggest weekly loss in more than two years. A regional healthcare index underperformed with a drop of 1%, after US President-elect Donald Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine sceptic, to lead the top US health agency. Tokyo's Nikkei, however, gained 0.7% driven by a pull back in the yen, which boosted the outlook for Japanese exporters. Still, it was down 1.7% for the week. The dollar gained for five days on the yen, up another 0.2% to 156.51, about the highest level since July. But yen bears were on guard as Japan's finance ministry kept up its warnings of government action against excessive currency moves. Bank of Japan also announced governor Kazuo Ueda will deliver a speech on Monday, which will be watched for any hints on the timing of the next rate hike. Chinese shares trimmed earlier losses as official data showed retail sales rose by a better-than-expected 4.8% in October, but growth in industrial output missed forecasts and declines in property investment deepened. China's blue chips were last down 0.1% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.9%. In the US policy front, even before Powell spoke, producer prices data showed that the core gauge surprised slightly to the upside, which also had markets worried about the pace of easing ahead. Short-term Treasury yields shot up overnight and remained elevated on Friday. The two-year yields held at 4.36%, having jumped 6 basis points overnight to close at 4.357%. In the currency markets, the dollar is set for a big weekly gain of 1.6% against its major peers. The euro nursed heavy losses at $1.0540 and is set for a hefty weekly loss of 1.7%. Minutes of the latest meeting from the European Central Bank showed the cut last month was likely an insurance move. Markets are, however, more dovish on the ECB and see a decent 36% chance it could step up its easing in December with a half-point move to guard against growth risks. They are also wagering that the ECB will have to cut at each meeting until mid next year. The lofty dollar pressured commodity prices, with gold prices down 4.3% this week to $2,568.55, bringing the monthly loss so far to a sizeable 8%. Oil are also down for the week. Brent crude futures are set for a weekly loss of 2.3% and were last at $72.15 a barrel. "

Topline Research predicts that the inflation rate for the current month will likely range between 4.5% and 5%. It predicts that inflation rate will fall below 5% after 78 months. This marks a significant improvement compared to the previous year, where the average inflation rate during the first five months was a staggering 28.62%. Topline Research forecasts that the average inflation rate for the first five months of this year will be around 7.91%. While this is still higher than the ideal rate, it represents a substantial reduction from the previous year. The report highlights that food inflation is expected to increase by 0.2% monthly, driven primarily by rising prices of eggs, daal moong, tomatoes, and potatoes by 5.35%. Additionally, charges in the housing, water, electricity, and gas sectors are projected to increase by 0.11% monthly, primarily due to a 7% monthly increase in LPG prices. However, a decline in electricity prices is anticipated due to negative fuel price adjustments. Also Read: Pakistan Stock Exchange hits historic high, crosses 96,000 mark The report said that the transport sector is expected to witness a 1.4% monthly increase, primarily attributed to rising petrol and diesel prices.

Sales fell 1.1% from the same month a year earlier to 1.92 million vehicles, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed. That compared with a 3.1% decline in July. New energy vehicle (NEV) sales, however, jumped 43.2% to account for a record 53.5% of total car sales, as local EV champion BYD set a sales record and U.S. rival Tesla had its best month of 2024. Car exports increased 24% after a 20% rise in July. The numbers reflected waning consumer confidence, with first-time car purchases lagging behind trade-ins, the association said last week. Drivers are eligible for a cash subsidy of as much as 20,000 yuan ($2,823) when trading in petrol-powered cars to buy NEVs, while those trading in petrol-powered cars for smaller-engine alternatives are entitled to up to 15,000 yuan. In line with a downshift in consumer spending, local EV majors Nio and Xpeng launched lower-priced brands earlier this year. Rising EV and plug-in hybrid sales have barely helped with challenges at dealerships that are battling price falls. More than half of dealerships suffered a loss in January-June, with the ratio up 7.3 percentage points from a year prior, data from the China Automobile Dealers Association showed.

The double-whammy of higher inventory costs and deeper discounts are a nightmare for auto dealers as that has a direct impact on their profit margins. ""With our inventory already at record levels, buyers are expecting even higher discounts,"" said Manish Raj Singhania, who is the president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. The comments came after sales of unsold cars in the world's No.3 auto market rose to a record 70-75 days in August, valued at 778 billion rupees ($9.27 billion). Discounts, too, are at an all-time high. Singhania hopes inventory levels will come down in October, during the Navratri and Deepavali festive seasons where Indians typically tend to make big-ticket purchases. Many buyers have deferred their purchases till October, hoping for higher discounts, FADA noted, adding that heatwaves in the summer months and heavy rains thereafter in different parts of the country have hurt showroom visits and delayed purchase decisions. Indeed, dealerships' sales of cars fell 4.5% in August, their third drop so far in the financial year that began in April. The slump in car purchases by retail buyers contrasts an upturn in overall consumer spending, which hit a seven-quarter high in April-June. Auto sales are seen as a key indicator of private consumption in the country. India's auto industry forms 7% of the country's GDP, as per government data. While newly launched models, particularly sport utility vehicles, continue to sell at a steady pace, dealers are unable to sell older models, including SUVs, Singhania said. ""Manufacturers must make efforts reduce sales to dealers and not bill more than what is retailing,"" he said."

Zok expects demand to rise as Charles III’s crowning approaches on Saturday. Elsewhere, the coronation has presented an obvious marketing opportunity.   The upmarket department store Fortnum & Mason, which supplies the royal family with its tea, is selling a special organic coronation Darjeeling for the coronation for £19.95 ($24.90) per 200 grams. “We chose Darjeeling because we understand that King Charles drinks this with a spoonful of honey,” said Ottilie Cunningham, one of the brand’s managers. “We decided to only select organic tea gardens in Darjeeling due to His Majesty’s passion for organic agriculture.” Ceramics company “Emma Bridgewater”, popular with royal collectors, has produced a wide variety of tableware for the occasion ranging from £12 to £28 for a mug, tea or coffee cup. All of its pieces are hand-decorated, the manufacturer says, adding that sales have started off on a high note and are expected to be better than for Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee last year. The coronation will also see sales of some six million coins and medals minted for the event, millions of pounds worth of jewelry, flags and banners as well as 10,000 teapots, according to forecasts by consultants the Center for Retail Research. The cost-of-living crisis will take a back seat, with Britons and tourists expected to spend more than £245 million on souvenirs alone – and more than £1.4 billion if the wider celebrations are included, it added. “Lots of people buying souvenirs will be older people… less affected by the cost of living crisis – they own their houses, have a pension,” said CRR director Joshua Bamfield. In the souvenir shops behind the palace, customers come in to browse an eclectic mix of royal memorabilia, looking to spend “£15 to £20”, according to store manager Ismayil Vadakkethil.   The items include protective gloves embossed with the royal coat of arms, Union Jack decorated paper towels and streamers and a “monarchy forever” T-shirt featuring the king. “My mother is a fanatic royalist, she’s got a glass cabinet with all of these royal things,” said Australian Julie Whitehead, 63. “So I’m going to pick up the King Charles ones for her because her cabinet is full of Queen Elizabeth ones,” she added. But while King Charles items sell well, so do souvenirs featuring the monarch’s late mother, who remains very popular with royal souvenir hunters. “I prefer the queen,” said Amélie Zerr, a 40-year-old French tourist, adding she was looking for a “small, kitschy souvenir” and had her heart set on a mug and a coaster. The customers have changed in recent times, Vadakkethil has noticed. “Recently I’ve noticed that it’s not just tourists coming in. People who work next door, in the offices, the Londoners themselves, they come into the shop,” he added. “People will be impressed by the ceremonial aspect and buy things to remember it,” he predicted. “It’s part of the British psyche.”"

This brings us to their unique business vertical, LMP. LMP allows Daraz to deliver in every city and area of Pakistan. It plays an important role in empowering the locals who are interested in starting a logistics business. The latter delivers Daraz packages utilizing its technology and expertise to run a logistics business. The model uplifts the local communities by creating business avenues and job opportunities mainly in tier 2 and tier 3 cities of Pakistan, and while doing so, it also helps them ensure that together, Daraz & LMP, provide a good delivery experience to their customer in these cities. Daraz is still in the works to expand its LMP network as it strives to find more partners in cities located in Punjab, Sindh, and other provinces. This is particularly important as the locals are well-versed in managing these deliveries, warehousing, and distribution, which complements Daraz’s focus on delivering a seamless shopping experience."

Welcome to Pakistan, a country where business dreams can turn into reality with the right knowledge and approach. Navigating Pakistan’s intricate business landscape requires a holistic understanding of demographics, investment policies, and taxation. With the right knowledge and strategy, entrepreneurs can unlock the vast potential of this dynamic nation and contribute to its journey toward prosperity. Don’t worry! We’re about to transform this seemingly mundane topic into an informative yet entertaining rollercoaster ride. Let’s dive in!!! Demographics of Pakistan   Pakistan is a demographic mosaic, shaped by a rapidly growing population and urbanization. According to the 7th Population and Housing Census in 2023, Pakistan ranks as the world’s sixth most populous country. The population growth rate from 2003-2022 averaged at 1.84%, indicating the nation’s substantial potential for economic expansion. Urbanization is a defining feature of Pakistan’s demographic landscape, with 36.1% of the population residing in urban areas. Investment policies in Pakistan To fuel economic growth and development, Pakistan has introduced the Pakistan Investment Policy 2023 (PIP 2023). This policy sets the stage for a business-friendly environment, aimed at attracting both local and foreign investments. PIP 2023 aligns with Pakistan Vision 2025, an ambitious plan to elevate the country to upper-middle-income status. It focuses on infrastructure development and encourages foreign direct investment (FDI) as a vital catalyst for growth. The country’s strategic location, abundant natural resources, a large and skilled workforce, and a commitment to becoming a global player in value chains make it an attractive prospect.  PIP 2023 introduces innovative strategies to enhance economic complexity and participation in global value chains (GVCs), which can be a game-changer for businesses. This policy builds upon the foundations laid by the Investment Policies of 1997 and 2013, extending its reach to various sectors and further streamlining processes. The goal is to create industrial clusters, harmonize trade and industrial policies, and promote sustainable economic growth. Key objectives of PIP 2023 include addressing economic priorities amidst global challenges, fostering sustainable growth in line with Sustainable Development Goals, attracting high-quality, export-oriented FDI, and boosting economic complexity through diversification. Tax overview Understanding Pakistan’s taxation system is vital for any business venture. The tax landscape in Pakistan includes both federal and provincial taxes, making it a multi-layered affair.  Direct taxes, like income tax, apply at both federal and provincial levels. On the other hand, indirect taxes, such as sales tax, are collected solely by the federal government. Recent tax developments in Pakistan include the introduction of the Super Tax, Capital Value Tax on specified assets, taxes on windfall income, and reforms in Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanisms. These changes reflect the government’s efforts to modernize the tax system and ensure fairness. For businesses in real estate and financial instruments, Pakistan offers specific tax regulations for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Collective/Investment Schemes, aiming to encourage investment in these sectors. Income Tax in Pakistan   Income tax – just hearing those two words might make you yawn. But did you know that the history of income tax in Pakistan is anything but boring? It’s a tale of twists and turns, with its origins tracing back to the days of British India. Let’s take a journey through time and explore the intriguing evolution of income tax in Pakistan. Income tax is complicated, it’s confusing, and it seems like it’s always changing. But it’s an important topic to understand because income tax is a major source of revenue for the government. Birth of income tax Our story begins in 1860 when the Government in India introduced ‘The Income Tax Act 1860,’ marking the birth of income tax in the region. This act established a scheduler income tax system, where different heads of income were taxed separately under various schedules. It even included a direct tax on agricultural income from land, showing that the taxman has always had a knack for finding new avenues for revenue.   However, this 1860 Act was short-lived, expiring in 1863, only to be replaced by a license tax. Income tax made a comeback in 1869 for a brief period. The 1870s and 1880s saw a see-saw of taxes and licenses due to financial difficulties. In 1886, the Government introduced the Income Tax Act, marking a significant step towards the tax system we have today. This act continued for 32 years, laying the groundwork for income taxation. The roaring twenties and independence Fast forward to 1918, and the Income Tax Act of 1918 breathed new life into income tax. It introduced a total income tax, abolished the scheduler system, and made income tax filing compulsory. This was a turning point.   When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, it adopted the Income Tax Act of 1922. This act allowed tax rates to be set annually through Finance Acts. This laid the foundation for Pakistan’s income tax system, which would evolve over the years. The 1979 shake-up The year 1979 marked a significant shift when General Zia-ul-Haq decided to replace the Income Tax Ordinance of 1979. The new ordinance, effective from July 1, 1979, brought changes to close loopholes in the previous system. The rushed change in 2001 Jump to 2001 when a new Income Tax Ordinance was promulgated on September 13, under pressure from international lending institutions. It became effective from July 1, 2002. This hurried change highlighted the intricate dance between national fiscal policies and global financial pressures. Residential status and taxable income Now, let’s delve into the nitty-gritty. Income tax in Pakistan operates under a residence-based tax system. Residents are taxed on their global income, while non-residents are taxed only on Pakistan-sourced income. Residential status hinges on factors like the number of days spent in Pakistan and employment status. Residents must meet specific conditions like being present in Pakistan for 183 days or more, working for the government, or being a Pakistani citizen not residing elsewhere for extended periods. Non-residents, on the other hand, are only taxed on income generated within Pakistan’s borders. Expatriates and special provisions Expatriates working in Pakistan bring a unique twist. A “short-term resident” concept exempts certain foreign-source income if the individual is present in Pakistan for a limited time due to employment. Special provisions also exist for income received under aid agreements and technical assistance agreements between Pakistan and foreign governments or international organizations. Tax rates: a peek into the present Tax rates in Pakistan are diverse, ranging from progressive rates for individuals to proportional or flat rates for companies. For instance, domestic companies face a general tax rate of 29%, but small companies enjoy a lower rate of 20%.  Individuals, on the other hand, face a progressive tax system, with rates increasing as income rises. This system encourages those who earn more to pay higher taxes. The future of tax in Pakistan The story of income tax in Pakistan is far from over. With changing economic landscapes and evolving fiscal policies, the tax system will continue to adapt. What might seem mundane at first glance is, in fact, a dynamic and ever-changing facet of our financial world. In Pakistan, there are two types of income tax: Individual income tax: This is the tax that individuals owe on their income. Corporate income tax: This is the tax that businesses owe on their income. Here are a few tips for filing your income taxes in Pakistan: Start early. The deadline for filing your taxes is June 30th, so it’s important to start early. This will give you plenty of time to gather all of the necessary paperwork and to avoid any last-minute rush. Keep good records. You will need to keep good records of your income and expenses in order to file your taxes accurately. This includes things like your salary slips, bank statements, and receipts for any deductible expenses. Use a tax professional. If you are not comfortable filing your taxes yourself, you can hire a tax professional to help you. A tax professional can help you to ensure that your taxes are filed correctly and that you are getting the maximum refund possible. The tax maze Let’s be honest; income tax rates aren’t everyone’s idea of a thrilling topic. But what if we told you that hidden beneath the numbers and percentages is a world of complexity and intrigue? Pakistan’s income tax rates, where we’ll unravel the mysteries behind the numbers and make this seemingly dull topic surprisingly entertaining. Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let’s understand how Pakistan’s income tax rates are structured. Taxable income is divided into categories, and each category has its own set of tax rates.   This ensures that the burden of taxation is distributed fairly based on income levels. Category 1: The non-salaried saga Imagine you’re not receiving a salary, but your taxable income is somewhere between zero and 75% of your total income. In this scenario, you fall into Category 1, and your tax rate varies depending on your income level. If your taxable income is up to Rs. 600,000, you pay 0% tax. Yes, you read that right; it’s a tax-free zone. If your income exceeds Rs. 600,000 but stays below Rs. 800,000, you’ll pay 7.5% on the amount above Rs. 600,000.   As your income grows further, the tax rate gradually increases. For example, if you earn between Rs. 800,000 and Rs. 1,200,000, you pay Rs. 15,000 plus 15% of the amount exceeding Rs. 800,000. This pattern continues as your income climbs the ladder, with tax rates increasing incrementally. So, the higher your income, the more taxes you pay, but it’s still a far cry from the daunting numbers you might have imagined. Deemed income: the hidden gem Now, let’s talk about “deemed income.” This is a tax on an amount equal to 5% of the Fair Market Value (FMV) of certain capital assets owned by a resident person in Pakistan.   The tax rate for this is 20%, which may sound steep, but there’s a twist. The effective tax rate is only 1% of the FMV of the capital asset. And here’s the kicker - this tax only applies to immovable property, so you won’t be taxed on your collection of vintage watches or classic cars. Capital gains: where timing matters Capital gains are like the fine print of the tax world. Depending on the nature of your asset, how long you’ve held it before selling, and various other factors, you’ll be taxed at different specified rates. This makes the income tax game feel like a chess match, where strategy is key. Minimum tax: the tax safety net Ever heard of “Minimum Tax”? This rule ensures that certain business entities pay a minimum tax amount, regardless of their actual profit or loss. For instance, a resident company, an individual, or an association of persons (AOP) with a turnover of Rs. 100 million or more falls into this category. But don’t worry; this isn’t a one-size-fits-all scenario. The tax liability is only triggered if it’s higher than 1.25% of turnover. So, even if your business isn’t making a profit or falls under exemptions, you still contribute to the nation’s finances. Alternative corporate tax: the accounting twist Corporate taxpayers, on the other hand, have an alternative. They can choose to pay tax at the rate of 17% of their accounting income (the profit before taxes as shown in their financial statements). This provides flexibility for businesses to optimize their tax liabilities. For example, if a company’s accounting income is higher under the alternative corporate tax than under the general provisions, they can carry forward the excess tax paid to offset future liabilities. It’s like having a financial safety net, ensuring taxes are paid even when profit margins are thin.   Final tax regime: simplicity for some Lastly, there’s the “Final Tax Regime.” This is a simplified approach where certain individuals or income streams pay tax on a percentage of their gross receipts, eliminating the need for detailed accounting or tax audits. It streamlines the process and eases the burden of tax compliance. Tax deadlines: the countdown Of course, to make sense of all these tax rates and rules, you need to meet deadlines. Taxpayers in Pakistan have various return and statement obligations, including annual filings, quarterly advance tax deposits, and withholding tax statements. Missing these deadlines can lead to penalties and fines, turning your tax adventure into a tax nightmare. So, there you have it - Pakistan’s income tax rates and rules, demystified and presented in a way that’s hopefully a bit more engaging than your average tax seminar. Buckle up, because we’re about to take you on a whirlwind tour of Pakistan’s tax regulations. Yes, taxes might not be the most thrilling topic, but trust us; there are twists, turns, and surprises hidden in the fine print of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO). Let’s dive in! Taxation of Persons Not on the Active Taxpayers List (ATL) First up, the ATL. This list is like the VIP club of taxpayers, and if you’re not on it, you face some tax-related adventures. If you’re not on the ATL, the taxman is going to turn up the heat. Certain withholding tax rates are increased by 100%, and in some cases, a staggering 250%! It’s like paying double or even triple the regular rate. But don’t worry; there’s a way out. If you’re not required to file an income tax return, you can get an exemption certificate from the Commissioner. If they don’t issue it within 30 days, you’re automatically granted permission not to have tax deducted at the enhanced rate. Now, if taxes are deducted at the higher rate, and you still don’t file your return, the Commissioner can swoop in with a provisional assessment order. That’s like a tax superhero coming to save the day, or maybe not! Purchasing assets: the banking channel drama The tax code wants to discourage cash transactions and promote transparency. So, when you’re buying big-ticket items like property worth more than Rs. 5 million or other assets exceeding Rs. 1 million, it’s a strict “no cash allowed” situation. You have to use crossed cheques, demand drafts, or other banking instruments for these transactions. If you don’t, you’re in for a double whammy: disallowed depreciation/amortization and a penalty of 5% of the purchase value. Ouch! Digital payments: a 21st century tax tale In the age of digital everything, the government is encouraging businesses to embrace digital payments. If you’re a company, and you want to claim an expense exceeding PKR 250,000, it has to be paid through digital means from your business bank account. But there are exceptions, like small expenses under Rs. 25,000 and essential payments like utility bills, travel fares, and taxes. However, these rules are waiting for official notification from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Tax administration and dispute resolution In Pakistan, tax administration involves audits by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). If you disagree with their assessment, the appeals process starts. It’s a bit like climbing a ladder with rungs labeled Commissioner (Appeals), Appellate Tribunal, High Court, and even the Supreme Court. Alternative dispute resolution: the tax truce The tax world has its version of diplomacy - it’s called the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). This system offers a simpler and less formal way to resolve tax disputes. If your tax liability is over PKR 100 million, you can opt for ADR. It’s like tax negotiations, and you can offer to pay your tax dues and resolve the dispute. If both parties agree, it’s a win-win. Avoidance of double taxation: the global tax safety net Nobody wants to pay taxes twice on the same income, right? That’s where double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAAs) come into play. Pakistan has signed these agreements with various countries to ensure that you’re not taxed on the same income by multiple nations. It’s like a global tax safety net. Anti-avoidance: closing the loopholes Anti-avoidance provisions are the tax code’s way of saying, “You can’t outsmart us.” These rules prevent tactics used to reduce or avoid taxes. For example, transfer pricing regulations make sure related parties don’t manipulate prices to reduce tax liabilities. And if a transaction doesn’t have any real economic effect, it can be disregarded. Automatic exchange of information: the tax transparency revolution Pakistan is part of the global movement toward tax transparency. The country has joined international agreements for the automatic exchange of financial information, allowing tax authorities to share data about taxpayers’ financial accounts. This helps prevent tax evasion and ensures everyone pays their fair share. Sales Tax on Goods   Taxing tale of sales tax on goods in Pakistan; a journey from partition to present The intricate world of sales tax on goods in Pakistan – from its provincial origins to its current federal form – this tax system plays a crucial role in the country’s revenue collection and distribution. For businesses and retailers, understanding these regulations is vital for compliance, while consumers may find it enlightening to peek behind the curtain of taxation that affects their purchases. While this subject might not initially sound like a thrilling read, bear with us, for within these paragraphs lies the story of how a provincial tax transformed into a federal affair, and how it impacts retailers and consumers alike. Provincial origin At the time of partition when sales tax was primarily a provincial levy, it was administered in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh, collecting revenue from goods sold within these regions. However, in 1948, a significant shift occurred. The General Sales Tax Act 1948 declared sales tax a federal subject, ushering in a new era in tax regulation. The federal sales tax system Today, sales tax in Pakistan operates as a Value Added Tax (VAT) system, an indirect tax that affects the consumption of goods by the general public. It applies throughout the supply chain, from importers to retailers, with a few exceptions. The aim is to shift the ultimate tax burden onto the final consumer while sparing intermediaries. Retailers in focus One of the most notable aspects of the current sales tax system is its treatment of retailers. They are divided into two categories, each with its own set of rules. 1. Tier 1 retailers This group includes national or international chains, retailers in air-conditioned malls, those with credit and debit card machines, and those with high electricity bills, wholesaler-cum-retailers, and retailers who accept digital payments.   For Tier 1 retailers, sales tax is charged at a standard rate of 18%. 2. Tier 2 retailers The second category consists of smaller retailers who do not meet the criteria for Tier 1. They are not required to register for sales tax, and they pay a fixed percentage of their monthly electricity bills, either 5% or 7.5%, depending on their bill amount. Importantly, they cannot claim input tax adjustment, and they are exempt from filing monthly sales tax returns. Tax rates and further tax The standard sales tax rate in Pakistan is 18%. However, an additional 4% is charged on goods supplied to unregistered persons. This further tax doesn’t apply to certain items like electrical energy, natural gas, and specific fuels. Special rates and fixed taxes The tax landscape isn’t one-size-fits-all. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has the authority to set lower or higher tax rates on specified items.   This flexibility allows for tailored taxation based on the nature of the goods. Exports and zero-rated supplies Export-oriented sectors like textiles, carpets, leather, sports, and surgical goods are typically taxed at the standard rate of 18%.   However, for certain conditions, such as maintaining a 4% value addition during the last six months, the rate can be reduced to 7.5%. Third schedule items Goods falling under the Third Schedule of the Sales Tax Act are taxed based on the recommended retail price set by the manufacturer or importer. This price must be clearly marked on the product label, along with the sales tax amount. Wholesalers and retailers also charge this tax when they sell these goods. The responsibility for paying sales tax falls on different parties depending on the situation. The person making the supply is usually responsible for remitting the tax. However, certain cases, specified by the FBR with the approval of the Federal Minister, reverse this responsibility.   Exemptions and Incentives There are various exemptions and incentives within Pakistan’s sales tax framework. These include zero-rated supplies, which allow suppliers to credit/adjust their input tax. Exempt supplies, on the other hand, are not subject to sales tax. Input tax adjustment Input tax adjustment is a crucial element for registered businesses. However, not all input tax is admissible, and there are restrictions. Input tax cannot be claimed for goods and services unrelated to taxable supplies or for personal or non-business use. Restriction on Input Tax Registered businesses are not allowed to adjust input tax in excess of 90% of their output tax. This restriction aims to ensure that businesses do not benefit excessively from input tax adjustments. The excess input tax cannot be refunded but can be carried forward to the next period. Sales Tax on Services   When services get taxed Picture this: you’re about to enjoy a leisurely weekend, planning to order a delicious meal through a food delivery app, catch a movie on your favorite streaming platform, and maybe even book a relaxing spa treatment online. What if I told you that your weekend indulgences are a part of a complex tax tango known as the sales tax on services? Don’t worry; this isn’t an attempt to dampen your spirits. Instead, we’re about to embark on a journey through the quirky world of sales tax on services, where provincial governments wield their tax wands in amusing ways. Introduction to the tax ballet: Goods vs. Services Most people are familiar with the idea of sales tax slapped onto physical goods - you buy a snazzy gadget, and there it is, that extra sum that the government claims. But wait, what about those moments when you’re booking a flight, subscribing to a streaming service, or getting your car repaired? Enter the provincial sales tax on services.   While the federal government takes care of taxing goods, provinces in many countries, including Pakistan, have decided to give services a slice of the tax pie. Taxpayer’s boogie: Self-assessment & compliance Now, imagine a tax system where the taxpayer plays both the lead dancer and the choreographer. In the world of provincial sales tax on services, this is reality. Taxpayers are entrusted with tasks like issuing tax invoices, determining their tax liabilities, filing sales tax returns, making tax payments, and maintaining meticulous records of their taxable escapades. It’s like stepping onto a dance floor where the moves are both tricky and crucial. Place of provision of services To make things even more interesting, authorities have crafted intricate rules to determine where the tax taps its toes. For instance, when it comes to advertisements, the location of a satellite’s beaming station or a TV channel’s landing rights can decide the tax’s destination. Even the virtual world isn’t spared - if an advertisement is placed on a website owned by someone not residing in Pakistan, the tax shuffle happens at the place of booking. Theatrical twists: Insurance and reinsurance Insurance services bring their own dramatic flair to the stage. The location of an insurance company’s office or branch might dictate where the tax performance unfolds. If you’re insuring movable property, the place of registration becomes the star of the show.   Marine insurance of goods choreographs its dance based on the port of embarkation or dis-embarkation. And don’t forget the dance partners - insurance agents and brokers, whose locations determine the tax’s rhythm. Invisible strings: Intellectual property and franchise services Intangible yet impactful, intellectual property and franchise services elegantly waltz through the tax landscape. If a person, whether residing in Pakistan or not, provides these services, the spotlight shines on the location of the recipient. But if the tax hasn’t found its way to a particular province, the resident provider’s location takes the lead. Highway jigs: Transportation of goods and power transmission Transportation services, like road trips for goods, have their own set of moves. If a service originates and ends within the same province, that province becomes the dance floor. And if the tax rates are different in the starting and ending provinces, the invoice becomes the dance partner, showcasing the tax split.   Electric power transmission services join the dance with their own intricacies. Whether originating and terminating within the same province or leaping between tax rates, these services execute a precise performance where tax equality takes center stage. The grand finale: Provincial tax schemes In this grand performance, different provinces play their parts with slight variations. Punjab, KPK, Baluchistan, Sindh, and Islamabad Capital Territory each have their own revenue authority and tax rates. These regional tax operas have captivating casts of tax rates for active and non-active entities, along with withholding tax rates that could make your head spin. Reverse charge and export of services The tax ballet isn’t complete without surprise twists. In the reverse charge routine, if a resident person receives a taxable service from a non-resident, they’re handed the tax bill. And when it comes to exporting services, the rules get more complex. While many services are exempt from sales tax on export, there are provinces that have decided to tax certain service categories. So, the next time you’re unwinding with your favorite services, remember that you’re not just indulging in relaxation; you’re participating in a charming, if perplexing, fiscal performance. Federal Excise Duty   Federal Excise Duty may not be the star of the tax world, but it’s a complex and intriguing character with its own quirks and rules. From its selective nature to the art of adjustment, and the enticing incentives, FED keeps the financial world on its toes. Now, before you let your eyelids droop, thinking this is just another dry discussion about taxes, hold your horses! FED is not your ordinary run-of-the-mill tax; it’s a complex, multi-faceted creature with more quirks and twists than your favorite mystery novel. So, put on your tax detective hat, and let’s explore the intriguing universe of FED. What is Federal Excise Duty, anyway? Picture this: You’re strolling through a bustling marketplace, eyeing those tempting goods on display. Little do you know that lurking in the background is our protagonist, Federal Excise Duty, or FED for short.   FED is essentially a tax, but it’s not out to get your everyday purchases. Instead, it sets its sights on specific goods and services outlined in the First Schedule of the Federal Excise Act. These items, my friends, are the chosen ones that bear the FED burden. The rest are safe, at least from this particular tax collector. Now, here’s the twist: while FED is only levied on goods and services listed in the First Schedule, Section 16 throws in a curveball. It boldly states that everything is exempt from FED, except for the items on that First Schedule. Confused? Don’t worry; you’re not alone. The bottom line is, FED applies to goods and services on the list, while sales tax goes after all goods unless they’re granted a specific exemption. Sneaky, right? The not-so-secret lives of FED Now that we’ve got the basics down, let’s dive deeper into the secret lives of FED. Here are some salient features that’ll make you look at this tax in a whole new light: FED on services: Normally, services taxed under provincial sales tax are safe from FED. But watch out for exceptions like passenger air travel, inland carriage of goods, services from port and terminal operators, and chartered flights. Geography matters: Goods produced in non-tariff areas (like Azad Jammu and Kashmir) but brought into tariff areas will face FED. Think of it as crossing tax borders. Imports included: Anything imported into Pakistan, no matter its final destination, is fair game for FED. FED math: The amount of FED you pay can vary. It might be calculated based on the value of the goods (ad valorem), their retail price, weight, quantity, measurement, units, charges, bills of lading, premiums, production capacity, machinery, establishment, installation, or even a fixed amount for certain goods or services. FED sure knows how to keep accountants on their toes. Art of FED adjustment Now, here’s where things get interesting. FED isn’t always a one-way street. If you’re a registered person and can prove that you’ve paid FED on goods used as direct inputs for manufacturing other excisable goods, you’re in for some adjustment magic.   Just make sure you’ve got the receipts – in the form of purchase invoices, goods declarations, or other official documents in your name. But wait, there’s a catch! Input tax adjustment is only available to manufacturers, and it’s strictly for goods used as direct inputs in the manufacturing process of excisable goods. It’s like a tax rebate for the industrious souls out there. Incentives to sweeten the deal FED, like any good tax, has its sweeteners. If your goods are headed for foreign shores, you might be in luck. FED doesn’t apply to goods exported out of Pakistan or those specified by the Federal Government.   And, in a stroke of genius, the Federal Board of Revenue can offer a refund of duty paid on goods used for manufacturing products that are later exported. Plus, provisions and stores for ships and aircraft heading out of Pakistan are FED-free. But here’s the plot twist: the FBR can also slap a “no refunds for you” sticker on certain exports to certain countries. It’s a mystery only they can solve. FED is payable by the manufacturer, importer, or distributor of goods and services that are subject to the tax. In some cases, FED may also be payable by the consumer. Here are some additional things to keep in mind about FED: • FED is a self-assessed tax, which means that businesses are responsible for determining their own liability for the tax. • FED returns must be filed on a quarterly basis. • Late filing or non-filing of FED returns can result in penalties and interest. • Businesses that fail to pay FED when due may be subject to enforcement action by the FBR. • If you have any questions about FED, you should consult with a tax advisor. Customs Duty   So, there you have it, the customs duty is not all black and white; there are complexities and nuances that can make your head spin faster than a rollercoaster. But understanding these intricacies is essential for businesses and individuals involved in international trade. This may sound as thrilling as watching paint dry, but trust me, it’s more like discovering hidden treasures in a labyrinth. While customs duty might not be the amazing topic out there, it’s a vital component of international trade and has a significant impact on the economy. Let’s dive in and uncover the secrets of Pakistan’s customs duty landscape. Customs duty is an important source of revenue for the government of Pakistan. It also helps to protect local industries from foreign competition. If you are importing goods into Pakistan, it is important to be aware of the customs duty regulations. You can find more information on the customs duty regulations on the website of the Federal Board of Revenue. Customs duty 101 Our story begins with the Customs Act of 1969. Yes, it’s been around for a while and has seen its fair share of amendments, but it’s still the big boss when it comes to customs duty in Pakistan. Customs duty is the toll you pay when you bring goods into Pakistan from another country, move goods from one Customs station to another, or liberate goods from a bonded warehouse. Now, here’s the kicker: the Federal Government holds the magical power to decide whether certain goods are exempt from these duties. They’re like the fairy godmother of trade, waving their wand and saying, “You shall not pay duty!” The salient features Harmonized system Think of this as the magical sorting hat from Harry Potter, but for goods. Pakistan uses the Harmonized System to classify items, which then determines their customs duty rates. These rates are listed in the Pakistan Custom Tariff, which is as extensive as a book series with 99 chapters. The duty rate can range anywhere from 0% to a dramatic 100%. Custom value To calculate customs duty, you need to know the custom value of your goods. It’s not just the sticker price; it includes the actual price you paid for the goods when they were exported to Pakistan. Plus, you have to throw in the cost of transportation (excluding inland freight), loading, unloading, handling, and insurance. It’s like a giant customs duty salad – all the ingredients matter.   Reduced rates of duty Sometimes, Pakistan wants to give its local industries a boost. To do this, they have a special list called the Fifth Schedule of the Customs Act, 1969. Goods listed here can enjoy reduced rates of duty, but there are strings attached in the form of conditions and restrictions. Additional customs duty The Federal Government has a secret weapon called Section 18(5) of the Customs Act, 1969. It allows them to impose additional customs duty through a gazette notification, but it can’t exceed 35% of the goods’ value. It’s like an extra tax, just when you thought you’d paid your dues. Regulatory duty Ever heard of a “short-term adjustment in imports”? Pakistan uses regulatory duty, permitted under Section 18(3) of the Customs Act, 1969, to achieve this. Through a gazette notification, the Federal Government can slap additional charges on imported or exported goods. These can range from 0% to a jaw-dropping 100%, but they can’t exceed the value of the goods. No export duty Good news for those shipping goods from Pakistan – there’s no export duty! You can send your locally made treasures off into the world without worrying about a customs bill on the way out. Exemptions for a cause Sometimes, goods are imported with the intention of exporting them later. In such cases, the Chief Customs Authority can give them a pass, but under certain conditions. For example, goods that are imported for personal use are exempt from customs duty, up to a certain limit. Additionally, goods that are imported for charitable purposes are also exempt from customs duty. Duty repayment for the greater good If you import goods for production, manufacturing, or repair, and it’s approved by the Federal Government, you might get your duty back. It’s like getting a refund on your taxes, but with more paperwork. Duty drawback Imagine paying customs duty on imported goods and then exporting them. Well, you’re in luck! Pakistan has a system where seven-eighths of that duty can be repaid as a drawback. But there’s a catch – you have to do this within two years, or maybe three if you’re lucky and get an extension. In some cases, customs duty that has already been paid can be repaid as drawback. This is possible if the goods are subsequently exported from Pakistan. Here are a few entertaining facts about customs duty in Pakistan; The highest rate of customs duty in Pakistan is 100%. This rate is applied to goods that are considered to be harmful to the economy or society. The lowest rate of customs duty in Pakistan is 0%. This rate is applied to goods that are considered to be essential or that are imported for charitable purposes. The most common rate of customs duty in Pakistan is 25%. This rate is applied to a wide range of goods, including electronics, clothing, and food. Understanding Corporate Laws   Welcome to the wild world of corporate laws in Pakistan! As you gear up for your business adventure, let’s take a thrilling safari through the dense legal jungle of corporate regulations. In Pakistan, businesses can take various forms, much like the animal kingdom’s diverse species. Here are the major types: 1. Company limited by shares This is the king of the corporate jungle. Shareholders’ liability is limited to the unpaid amount on their shares, ensuring they won’t be chased by financial predators beyond their investment. 2. Company limited by guarantee Here, members commit to contributing to the company’s assets if it’s winding up while they’re still on board or shortly after they leave. It’s like an insurance policy for the corporate savannah. 3. Unlimited company These companies roam without limits, as the name suggests. But they’re more like the elusive creatures of the corporate world, often seen in the shadows. 4. Private company Private companies are like tightly-knit herds. They restrict share transfers, limit their membership to fifty, and avoid public gatherings for share or debenture subscriptions. 5. Single-member company A single-member company is like a solo adventurer in the corporate wilderness. It’s ideal for individuals who want limited liability but still need a sidekick (a nominee director) in case things get tricky. The enigma of Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) Limited Liability Partnerships are the chameleons of the business world, blending the features of partnerships and companies. Partners here enjoy limited liability, unlike traditional partnerships where they are more exposed to the wilds of financial liability. In an LLP, they can manage the business directly, much like independent hunters. Public vs. Private companies Public companies are the social butterflies of the corporate jungle, requiring a minimum of three members and having no restrictions on share transfers.   They can even strut their stuff on the stock exchange, but only after winning over at least 500 shareholders. Meanwhile, private companies keep things cozy with a maximum of fifty members, limited share transfers, and no public share-and-tell sessions. Special considerations for foreign companies Foreign companies eyeing the Pakistani landscape must secure approval from the Board of Investment (BOI) to establish their presence. It’s like obtaining a visa to explore a new territory. The wildlife guide: policy parameters Foreign companies have different hunting grounds depending on their sectors: Manufacturing Sector: No special permissions required, just watch out for a few specified industries like arms and ammunitions or high explosives. Agriculture: No need for extra permits, but keep in mind the specifics of Corporate Agriculture Farming (CAF). Infrastructure and Social Services (including IT and Telecom): Specific licenses may be required, but there’s ample room for foreign companies to roam. Dividends, Royalties, and the Money Trail Dividends can be remitted to non-resident shareholders once a bank is nominated by the company. Royalties and technical fees can also be dispatched smoothly, but there are rules to follow. Manufacturing sectors have their own conditions for remittance. Non-manufacturing sectors have a USD 100,000 lump-sum limit, keeping things simple. Loans and guarantees   Foreign-controlled companies can take loans for working capital, but they must adhere to strict terms. Rupee loans are allowed for capital expenditures in manufacturing, but other sectors need special permission. Loans against guarantees of non-residents are a common practice, as long as you’re playing by the rules. Foreign nationals are welcome to become directors in Pakistani companies. It’s like inviting an exotic bird to join your local flock. All it takes is a clearance from the Ministry of Interior. Foreign directors need to submit passport copies, personal profiles (basically their resumes), and an affidavit promising to transfer shares if they don’t get that all-important security clearance. The quest for registration To embark on this corporate safari, you’ll need a few documents for registration:   • Passport copies of foreign subscribers. • Four copies of the Memorandum and Articles of Association (in case of offline submission). • Forms for declarations, registered office details, director particulars, and Ultimate Beneficial Owners. • The all-important registration fee, paid at any authorized branch of MCB Bank Limited. As you navigate the corporate terrain in Pakistan, remember that the jungle has its rules, but it also has its rewards. With the right knowledge and preparation, you can make your business venture a thrilling and successful expedition. So, pack your legal survival kit, put on your corporate explorer’s hat, and venture forth into the world of business in Pakistan. The wild awaits! The type of company that is right for you will depend on a number of factors, including the size of your business, the amount of capital you need, and your goals for the business. If you are starting a small business with a few partners, a private company may be the best option for you. If you are looking to raise a large amount of capital and have a high-profile business, a public company may be the best option for you. And if you are looking for a hybrid option that offers the benefits of both private companies and public companies, an LLP may be the best option for you. No matter which type of company you choose, it is important to consult with an attorney to ensure that you are complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Pakistan’s Foreign Exchange Laws for Business Success   Buckle up as we unravel the mysteries and secrets of conducting business in Pakistan! 1. Foreign Exchange Regulations Picture this: you’re a business enthusiast ready to take a plunge into the Pakistani market. As you step onto this bustling stage, you’ll be waltzing to the rhythm of the “Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947.” This act is the star of the show, directing the tango of foreign currencies within the country. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) takes the lead here, setting the rules and ensuring everyone’s toes stay in line. But here’s the plot twist - foreign investment in Pakistan gets the VIP treatment. The “Foreign Private Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act, 1976” rolls out the red carpet for foreign investors. It’s like an insurance policy for your investments, guaranteeing that you can waltz out of Pakistan with your original investment, profits, and any capital appreciation. Impressive, right? However, the business world is a dynamic stage, and new characters enter the scene. The “Foreign Currency Account Rules, 2020” made their grand entrance in October 2020. These rules, while shaking up the dance floor, limit the types of funds that can be credited to foreign currency accounts. Keep an eye on these updates; they might just change your choreography. 2. Thrill of possessing foreign currency Now, this is where Pakistan’s foreign exchange laws show their open-mindedness. Pakistan welcomes both residents and non-residents to strut into the country with foreign currency in tow. No restrictions, no questions asked. This openness encourages international trade and investment, making Pakistan a stage fit for global players. But don’t get too carried away; there’s a catch. You can bring in all the foreign currency you want, but when it’s time to exit the stage, you’re limited to USD 10,000. It’s like a curfew for your dollars. So, plan your financial finale accordingly. 3. The enigmatic foreign currency accounts Imagine having a secret vault where you can stash your foreign currency, accessible only to a select few. Well, in Pakistan, foreign firms, companies, and individuals have a chance to maintain these secret vaults, known as “foreign currency accounts” (FCAs), with banks. But here’s the twist - there are conditions. The Foreign Exchange Manual holds the map to these treasure chests. These accounts are your backstage pass to manage your foreign currency holdings within Pakistan’s financial realm. 4. The Roshan Digital Account Revolution Cue the drumroll for Pakistan’s superstar initiative - the Roshan Digital Account scheme! This is the plot twist every foreign investor has been waiting for. Overseas Pakistanis can now invest in Pakistan’s stock market and real estate funds without needing to physically fly into the country. It’s like investing in a blockbuster movie while sipping tea in your pajamas. The magic of the Roshan Digital Account doesn’t stop there. Funds in these accounts can be repatriated without the hassle of seeking prior approval from the SBP. It’s the showstopper feature that’s changed the game for Non-Resident Pakistanis (NRPs) and foreign investors alike. 5. The Revolution in Disinvestment Proceeds In the world of business, disinvestment proceeds are the bittersweet notes of the finale. But in Pakistan, this melody is changing. Now, companies can remit disinvestment proceeds to non-resident shareholders without the need for prior SBP approval. The banks take center stage, processing these remittances with fewer documents and fewer headaches. It’s a harmonious ending to a long and complex symphony. Now that we’ve conquered the intricacies of foreign exchange, let’s move on to some groundbreaking laws that Pakistan has introduced to pave the way for foreign investment and economic growth. 1. The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC): Think of it as your business fairy godmother. This council has the power to make dreams come true by issuing recommendations, relaxing regulatory requirements, and acting as a one-stop-shop for international investors. It’s the secret ingredient in Pakistan’s recipe for a thriving investment climate. 2. Export-Import Bank of Pakistan (EIBP): This institution is like a financial genie, granting wishes to businesses engaged in international trade. From trade financing to trade credit insurance, it’s here to make cross-border deals smoother and more secure. 3. Regulation of Mines and Oilfields and Mineral Development Amendment Act, 2022: For those seeking treasures in Pakistan’s mineral-rich lands, this amendment empowers provincial governments to negotiate agreements for mineral exploration and development. It’s the map to the kingdom’s hidden treasures. 4. Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act, 2022: This act is the key to unlocking economic collaborations between Pakistan’s federal government and foreign states. It paves the way for government-to-government agreements, ensuring that both parties reap the benefits. 5. Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act, 2022: Remember that dream project in Balochistan? This act ensures that investors get the royal treatment with incentives, tax exemptions, and long-term security, even if the script changes. So there you have it, intrepid business explorers. Pakistan’s foreign exchange laws are like the choreography of an intricate dance. Master them, and you’ll waltz your way to success on this captivating stage of business opportunities. With these laws and initiatives in your toolkit, you’re poised for an exhilarating journey into the land of limitless potential. Break a leg!"

Brent crude futures dropped 31 cents, or 0.4%, to $73.56 a barrel by 0340 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $70 a barrel, down 38 cents, or 0.5%. Both benchmarks fell more than 2% last Friday. Beijing's stimulus package announced at the National People's Congress (NPC) standing committee meeting on Friday fell short of market expectations, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said in a note, adding that its murky forward guidance hinted at only modest stimulus for housing and consumption. ANZ analysts said the lack of direct fiscal stimulus implied that Chinese policymakers have left room for assessing the impact of the policies the next U.S. administration will introduce. ""The market will now shift focus to the Politburo meeting and Central Economic Work Conference in December, where we expect more pro-consumption countercyclical measures to be announced,"" they added in a note. Oil consumption in China, the world's driver of global demand growth for years, has barely grown in 2024 as its economic growth has slowed, gasoline use has declined with the rapid growth of electric vehicles and liquefied natural gas has replaced diesel as a truck fuel. Oil prices have also eased after concerns about supply disruption from storm Rafael in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico subsided. More than a quarter of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and 16% of natural gas output remained offline on Sunday, according to the offshore energy regulator. Shell and Chevron each said on Sunday they would start redeploying personnel to their Gulf of Mexico platforms to resume operations. Looking ahead, uncertainty from policies under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have clouded the global economic outlook although expectations that he could tighten sanctions on OPEC producers Iran and Venezuela and cut oil supply to global markets partly caused oil prices to gain more than 1% last week. Oil markets are also being supported by firm demand from U.S. refiners who are expected to run their plants at above 90% of their crude processing capacity on low inventories and improving demand for gasoline and diesel, executives and industry experts said."

Brent crude oil futures fell 47 cents, or 0.6%, to $75.16 per barrel by 0446 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 55 cents or 0.8% to $71.81. The benchmarks fell after rising nearly 1% on Thursday. For the week, Brent is set to gain 3.1% while WTI is set to rise 4.1% Hurricane Rafael, which has caused 391,214 barrels per day of US. crude oil production to be shut, is expected to move slowly westward over the Gulf of Mexico and away from US fields while forecast to weaken from Friday and through the weekend, the US National Hurricane Center said. Prices gained support on Thursday on expected actions by the incoming Trump administration such as tighter sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, which could limit their supply to global markets. ""Our core view sees Trump adopt a relatively pragmatic approach to policy, in which he either chooses not to pursue more radical policy shifts, or is held back by institutional constraints or the influence of more moderate policy advisers,"" BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said in a note on Friday. Downward pressure came from data showing crude imports in China, the world's biggest oil importer, fell 9% in October, the sixth consecutive month showing a year-on-year decline, as well as from a rise in US crude inventories. ""The impact (of the Trump administration) on oil market fundamentals in 2025 will likely be somewhat limited,"" BMI said."

SIFC has given the Petroleum Division directions for the refinery upgrade projects, with a vital step in the establishment of the hydrocracker unit at PARCO. This segment is designed to transform furnace oil into high-value petroleum products, such as petrol and diesel. According to the project, the authorities foresee the hydrocracker unit as a billion-dollar investment that will be sufficient money. This was confirmed by the statement issued by the refineries that they have made a move to the government requesting them to be super generous on sales tax for petrol and diesel products, which are vital to the overall energy sector. The recent amendments to the sales tax ordinance are SIFC's demonstration of their dedication to investment in the sector. The Sales Tax Act 1990, which now covers all goods and services, is in the process of being amended to allow for these changes. Developers of energy now predict that the sector's innovative solutions will be, under the umbrella of SIFC's new strategies, a more important contributor to Pakistan's financial stability."

According to industry sources, petrol prices are suggested to rise by Rs2.60 per liter, while high-speed diesel (HSD) may see an increase of Rs6 per liter. The price adjustments are proposed based on the current tax rates, with exchange rate effects reportedly kept zero in these calculations. The proposed price hikes include a Rs6 increase per liter for light diesel and Rs5 per liter for kerosene. The current petroleum levy stands at Rs60 per liter on petrol and diesel. Additionally, the ex-refinery rates for petrol and diesel have reportedly climbed by Rs2.58 and Rs6.20, respectively, with the premium per barrel increasing by $1. The oil price adjustments summary will be submitted to the government on November 15, following which the Ministry of Finance will make a final decision. The ministry, with approval from the prime minister, holds authority to amend prices and adjust taxes keeping in mind its revenue targets. As of now, the transportation costs for petrol and diesel are estimated at Rs7.89 and Rs4.17 per liter, respectively. If approved, the expected increase could impact consumers amid rising costs across essential commodities. The IMF has proposed imposing a General Sales Tax (GST) on petroleum products and increasing the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) from Rs60 to Rs70 per litre. The latest price hike on October 31 pushed petrol prices up by Rs1.35 per litre, setting the new rate at Rs248.38 per litre. High-speed diesel (HSD) saw a more substantial increase of Rs3.85, now priced at Rs255.14 per litre."

This development marks a significant contribution to Pakistan's natural gas output. According to a letter from OGDCL to the Pakistan Stock Exchange, the Uch-35 well is producing an impressive five million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMSCFD). The gas output has been successfully integrated into the Uch Gas Processing Plant, which will aid in streamlining and distributing the additional gas supply. OGDCL, the country’s largest exploration and production company, holds complete ownership of the Dera Bugti well, as confirmed in its letter to the PSX. On Nov 12, Pakistan decided to stop the purchase of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and redirect it to domestic consumers, following a reduction in electricity consumption. Also Read: Pakistan decides to direct imported LNG to domestic use According to documents from the Ministry of Petroleum, providing LNG to domestic consumers will require an investment of Rs163 billion. Sources said that the imported LNG is increasing pressure on pipelines on a daily basis. Sources confirmed that the power sector had been using 600 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of LNG. With the closure of captive power plants, 150MMcfd of LNG will now become surplus, while the gas sector is also earning a revenue of Rs400 billion from captive power. The government plans to address the circular debt issue by increasing gas tariffs and removing the tariff difference between imported LNG and local gas. Currently, the tariff for local gas is set at Rs1,550 per MMcfd, while the tariff for imported LNG is Rs3,500 per MMcfd. By eliminating this tariff disparity, the government expects to generate Rs200 billion in revenue. Additionally, the tariff for fertilizer companies will also be increased as part of the broader plan to boost government revenue."

The dollar is reaping the benefits of Republican Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election last week, sitting not far from Tuesday's high of 106.17, its strongest since May 1. Investors are pricing in policies of lower taxes and trade tariffs under the incoming administration that are seen as inflationary. Meanwhile, Republicans inched closer to gaining full control of Congress, which would give the president-elect power to advance his agenda. The Trump trade has also pushed up US Treasury yields as markets wager the Federal Reserve may temper the extent of its future rate cuts. But momentum slowed on Wednesday as markets awaited a fresh read on US inflation, with the October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report to be released later in the day. ""Focus is likely to shift back to inflation and Fed policy in the latter part of the week, but whether that brings an unwinding of Trump trades remains to be seen,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo. With investors already viewing Trump policies as inflationary, the market could be ""more sensitive"" if CPI comes in hotter-than-expected, she added. The core gauge is expected to rise 0.3% in October. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak this week, ahead of US Producer Price Index (PPI) data on Thursday and retail sales on Friday. Markets currently have about a 60% chance of another quarter basis point cut from the Fed priced in for December, down from around 84% a month ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. The US dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of currencies, tacked on 0.04% to 106.03. Bitcoin paused its record-breaking climb, down about 1% at $87,450 after hitting an all-time high of $89,998 on Tuesday. Trump has vowed to make the US ""the crypto capital of the planet"". The dollar was up 0.12% against the yen at 154.80 after touching 154.934, its highest against the Japanese currency since July 30. Japan's wholesale inflation accelerated in October at the fastest annual pace in more than a year as renewed yen falls pushed up import costs for some goods, complicating the Bank of Japan's decision on how soon to raise interest rates. The euro struggled for support amid political uncertainty as Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, is set to hold elections on Feb. 23, weeks after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition. Meanwhile, markets are pondering potential Trump tariffs against Europe, as well as China. The euro was pinned near a one-year low of $1.0595 hit on Tuesday, and was last down 0.09% at $1.0615. Sterling was nearly flat at $1.27475, under pressure from a broadly firmer greenback. The offshore yuan traded at 7.2354 yuan per dollar, up about 0.14%. RBC strategists believe the greenback's gains ""are not yet exhausted,"" with the scale of Trump's win giving him a ""clear electoral mandate to pursue his policy agenda,"" they wrote in a note to clients. ""Most of Trump's policy proposals argue in favour of USD strength, even if he himself prefers a weaker currency."" Elsewhere, the Aussie fell 0.05% to fetch $0.6529. Australian wages rose at the slowest annual pace since late 2022 in the third quarter amid an influx of new workers and an easing in inflation, adding somewhat to the case for cuts in interest rates."

""Markets are dialling back expectations of Fed cuts going forward, with a cut at the December meeting being thrown into question."" Trump's Republican Party will control both houses of Congress when he takes office in January, Decision Desk HQ projected on Monday.

Food prices, which make up nearly half of the inflation basket, likely increased at a faster pace last month. Tomatoes, a key ingredient in every Indian kitchen, are expected to have surged by double digits in price as uneven rains disrupted production. The government's decision to raise import taxes on edible oils by 20 percentage points in mid-September also likely helped to drive prices up faster, further straining household budgets. Annual retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) likely rose a second straight month to 5.81% in October, the highest since August 2023, according to the median forecast from a Nov. 4-8 Reuters poll of 52 economists. It rose to 5.49% in September, higher than forecast. Estimates for the data, set to be released on Nov. 12 at 1030 GMT, ranged from 5.00% to 6.30%, with nearly a third predicting inflation to hit 6.00% - the upper boundary of the RBI's 2%-6% target range - or above. ""There is broad-based price pressure with a pronounced increase visible in tomatoes and edible oil. For the former, lower arrivals were primarily due to a lagged impact of unseasonal rains observed in September. For edible oils, a sharp increase is visible because of imported inflation,"" Dipanwita Mazumdar, economist at Bank of Baroda, said. ""Going forward, rising intensity of climate risks, weaker currency against a stronger dollar and geopolitical risks might pose further upside risks to inflation,"" she said. The rupee fell to its weakest ever on Thursday following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election. An overall strong dollar, with downward pressure on the rupee, may be one constraint preventing inflation from softening quickly. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy and is seen as a better gauge of domestic demand, was forecast to be 3.60% in October, according to the median estimate from a smaller sample of 21 surveyed. ""Core would also be on the upside due to frontloading of festive demand and higher gold prices,"" Mazumdar said. The Indian statistics agency does not publish core inflation data. Economists estimated it at 3.50% in September. Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday highlighted the upside risks to inflation, dampening immediate expectations for a rate cut. A slim majority in a separate Reuters poll expected the RBI to cut its key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% in December. However, with inflation not expected to return to the 4% medium-term target until at least 2026, economists in the poll cautioned that rate cut could be delayed until early next year. ""I don't think it's cast in stone what the rate cut cycle should look like ... If you look at RBI's forecast of growth, there is very little reason why support to growth is needed,"" said Suvodeep Rakshit, senior economist at Kotak Institutional Equities. The RBI predicts economic growth of 7.2% economic growth this fiscal year, which some economists consider to be optimistic. Separately, wholesale price index-based inflation is expected to have surged to an annual 2.20% last month from 1.84% in September, the survey showed."

During its stay, the sources said, the IMF delegation will be briefed on tax revenue performance, trader-friendly scheme, and reforms in the energy sector. The discussions will include discussions on the features of a possible mini-budget to meet the annual tax target. The IMF delegation will be apprised of the progress in implementation of an agricultural income tax at the provincial level, although sources indicate that provincial governments have failed to meet the October deadline for legislation. The IMF mission will also be briefed on the arrangements for bridging the $2.5 billion financing gap.

Spot gold dropped 0.5% to $2,669.22 per ounce, as of 0306 GMT. US gold futures fell 0.7% to $2,675.90. ""Gold prices were previously seen as a hedge against US political risks, and a quicker-than-expected conclusion in the elections may be a trigger for some near-term unwinding, along with the firmer US dollar,"" said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong. On Friday, spot gold prices registered their worst week in more than five months as Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election has raised the prospect of higher tariffs which could keep interest rates elevated. ""We may expect the Fed to be more cautious in its easing process ahead, which could cap gold prices,"" Yeap said. Bullion is considered a hedge against inflation, but higher rates raise the opportunity cost of holding it. Several Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, are scheduled to speak this week. Additionally, US consumer and producer price index data, weekly jobless claims and retail sales figures are due this week.

The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said 2,000 employers surveyed from Sept 18 to Oct 9 reported that median expected pay rises for the coming 12 months in the public sector had risen to 4% from 2.5% the quarter before. This took the public sector above the median for private-sector pay settlements, which held at 3%. Looking at the next three months alone, public-sector employers expected new settlements to raise pay by a median 5%. ""Significant public sector pay awards announced since the election, along with the additional public sector spending announced in the recent budget, have provided a welcome boost to public sector employers and workers,"" James Cockett, the CIPD's senior labour market economist, said. Shortly after taking office in July, British finance minister Rachel Reeves announced pay rises of 4.75%-6% for millions of public-sector workers. During the pandemic, public-sector pay lagged behind both rises in the private sector and a sharp increase in inflation. Cockett said private-sector firms now faced increased costs which would likely affect their hiring plans and wage setting. Reeves on Oct. 30 unveiled the biggest tax increases since 1993, including a 25 billion pound ($32 billion) jump in social security contributions paid by employers alongside a 6.7% rise in the minimum wage. ""These increased business costs are likely to act as a barrier to growth and could lead to employers offering lower pay rises, being more cautious about investing in workers' skills or taking on new staff,"" Cockett said. Official data on Tuesday is expected to show annual growth in average weekly earnings overall - which tends to be higher than pay settlements - slowed to 4.7% in the three months to September from 4.9% in the three months to August. The Bank of England is closely monitoring wage growth as it tries to gauge inflation pressure in the economy. Last week it said further interest rate cuts are likely to be gradual after it cut the benchmark Bank Rate to 4.75% from 5%."

The report highlights that 60% of Pakistan's budget revenue is being spent on interest payments on loans, with government debt rising significantly. This has placed the country in a precarious financial position, the report stated, requiring strict budget control in the coming years. The IMF noted that better fiscal discipline will remain a significant challenge while maintaining necessary social and development expenditures. The report also identified external financial pressures, unusual floods, and wrong policy decisions as major contributors to Pakistan's current economic challenges. The IMF proposed several measures to enhance Pakistan's budgeting processes and financial stability. The report recommends aligning the structure of the Finance Ministry with international best practices. Capacity building and reorganisation of the ministry were needed as essential steps for effective budgeting, it added. Stressing the importance of fiscal discipline, the IMF report urged Pakistan to adhere to the Supreme Court's 2013 decision on supplementary grants. The supplementary budget should be scrutinised according to the 2013 verdict, it added. It advised prior approval from the National Assembly for significant financial decisions, as well as amendments to relevant laws and regulations to improve transparency and accountability. The report stressed the need for a comprehensive digitalisation master plan, adding that it is difficult to transition from a primary fiscal deficit to a primary surplus, emphasizing the importance of credible budget presentations and their effective implementation.

On Sunday, OPEC+, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other allies, said it would extend its output cut of 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month in December, with an increase already delayed from October because of falling prices and weak demand. The grouping had been due to increase output by 180,000 bpd from December. ""While the delay until January does not change fundamentals significantly, it does potentially leave the market having to rethink the strategy of OPEC+,"" ING analysts said in a note. The delay bucked the expectations of some in the market for OPEC+ to deliver the planned hike in output, they added. ""This delayed supply increase means that maybe the group are more willing to support prices than many believe,"" they said. The group is set to gradually unwind the 2.2-million-bpd cut over the coming months, while another 3.66 million bpd of production cuts will stay until the end of 2025.

It is questionable whether the price uptrend will be sustained as previous initial positive reaction to the delayed output hike and geopolitical tension have eventually fizzled off, said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG.

The U.S. warned Iran at the United Nations Security Council of ""severe consequences"" if it undertakes any further aggressive acts against Israel or U.S. personnel in the Middle East. In the U.S., crude oil and gasoline stockpiles likely rose last week, while distillate inventories were seen down, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday. The American Petroleum Institute industry group is scheduled to release a weekly report on Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, will issue one on Wednesday."

Both Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures hit their lowest levels since Oct. 1 at the open. By 0139 GMT, Brent was at $72.70 a barrel, down $3.35, or 4.4%, while WTI slipped $3.27, or 4.6%, to $68.51 a barrel. The benchmarks gained 4% last week in volatile trade as markets priced in uncertainty around the extent of Israel's response to the Iranian missile attack on Oct. 1 and the U.S. election next month. Scores of Israeli jets completed three waves of strikes before dawn on Saturday against missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran, in the latest exchange in the escalating conflict between the Middle Eastern rivals. The geopolitical risk premium that had built in oil prices in anticipation of Israel's retaliatory attack came off, analysts said. ""The more limited nature of the strikes, including avoiding oil infrastructure, have raised hopes for a de-escalatory pathway, which has seen the risk premium come off a few dollars a barrel,"" Saul Kavonic, a Sydney-based energy analyst at MST Marquee, said. ""The market will be watching closely for confirmation Iran won't counter attack in coming weeks, which could see the risk premium rise again."" Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar expects market attention to turn to ceasefire talks between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hamas that resumed over weekend. ""Despite Israel’s choice of a low aggression response to Iran, we have doubts that Israel and Iran’s proxies (i.e. Hamas and Hezbollah) are on track for an enduring ceasefire,"" he said in a note. Citi lowered its Brent price target in the next three months to $70 a barrel from $74, factoring in a lower risk premium in the near term, its analysts led by Max Layton said in a note. Analyst Tim Evans at U.S.-based Evans Energy said in a note: ""We think this leaves the market at least somewhat undervalued, with some risk OPEC+ producers may push back the planned increase in output targets beyond December."" In October, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, kept their oil output policy unchanged including a plan to start raising output from December. The group will meet on Dec. 1 ahead of a full meeting of OPEC+."

Brent crude futures dropped 31 cents, or 0.4%, to $73.56 a barrel by 0340 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $70 a barrel, down 38 cents, or 0.5%. Both benchmarks fell more than 2% last Friday. Beijing's stimulus package announced at the National People's Congress (NPC) standing committee meeting on Friday fell short of market expectations, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said in a note, adding that its murky forward guidance hinted at only modest stimulus for housing and consumption. ANZ analysts said the lack of direct fiscal stimulus implied that Chinese policymakers have left room for assessing the impact of the policies the next U.S. administration will introduce. ""The market will now shift focus to the Politburo meeting and Central Economic Work Conference in December, where we expect more pro-consumption countercyclical measures to be announced,"" they added in a note. Oil consumption in China, the world's driver of global demand growth for years, has barely grown in 2024 as its economic growth has slowed, gasoline use has declined with the rapid growth of electric vehicles and liquefied natural gas has replaced diesel as a truck fuel. Oil prices have also eased after concerns about supply disruption from storm Rafael in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico subsided. More than a quarter of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and 16% of natural gas output remained offline on Sunday, according to the offshore energy regulator. Shell and Chevron each said on Sunday they would start redeploying personnel to their Gulf of Mexico platforms to resume operations. Looking ahead, uncertainty from policies under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have clouded the global economic outlook although expectations that he could tighten sanctions on OPEC producers Iran and Venezuela and cut oil supply to global markets partly caused oil prices to gain more than 1% last week. Oil markets are also being supported by firm demand from U.S. refiners who are expected to run their plants at above 90% of their crude processing capacity on low inventories and improving demand for gasoline and diesel, executives and industry experts said."

The new discounts, which range from Rs2 lac to Rs8 lac, are expected to provide significant savings for buyers, with the promotions running until December 31, 2024. The announcement, which took effect on November 8, 2024, comes as part of Hyundai’s strategy to remain competitive in a market that is still grappling with the aftermath of a prolonged economic downturn. According to the company, these reductions are designed to stimulate sales and clear out existing stock ahead of upcoming models, particularly as the brand seeks to recapture market share lost to other automakers. The price reductions apply across all variants of the Tucson and Santa Fe models. The Tucson, one of Hyundai’s best-selling SUVs, will see a flat Rs. 2 lac reduction across all four variants. Meanwhile, the Santa Fe Hybrid, which is a high-end offering in Hyundai's SUV lineup, will benefit from larger cuts—up to Rs. 8 lac on its top-tier variant.

In an official statement, a spokesperson from the directorate confirmed that the current passport fee structure remains unchanged, dismissing reports of an impending increase as “baseless.” The spokesperson outlined that fees for passport issuance, based on category and page count, have not been altered since March. Under the existing structure, the five-year fee for a 36-page passport is set at Rs4,500 for normal processing, Rs7,500 for urgent, and Rs12,500 for fast-track service. For a 72-page passport, the five-year fees are Rs8,200 for normal processing, Rs13,500 for urgent, and Rs18,500 for fast-track.Additionally, the re-issue fee for a lost 36-page passport begins at Rs9,000, with subsequent losses incurring double or triple fees. The spokesperson advised citizens to ignore the unfounded rumours, reiterating that current passport fees apply to various document types, including machine-readable passports (MRPs) and e-passports, depending on page count and service category. Earlier, some media reports suggested a new fee structure, allegedly released by the federal government, with separate charges for machine-readable and e-passports. For instance, the reports mentioned a fee of Rs3,000 for a standard 36-page e-passport with a five-year validity, rising to Rs15,000 for urgent processing. A 75-page e-passport was said to be priced at Rs15,500 for normal service, with an urgent fee of Rs27,000 for a 10-year validity. For MRPs, the speculated fees included Rs4,500 for a five-year, 36-page passport under normal processing, Rs7,500 for urgent, and Rs13,500 for fast-track. The Directorate of Passport and Immigration, responsible for issuing passports to citizens meeting the official criteria, affirmed that the current fee structure remains in place, with no changes being implemented as previously reported."

In its latest stimulus measures, the country's top legislative body approved a 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) package on Friday to ease local government ""hidden debt"" burdens, rather than directly injecting money into the world's second-biggest economy, as some investors had hoped. Analysts say the package will likely do little to boost economic activity, demand and prices in the near term. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% from a year earlier last month, slowing from September's 0.4% rise and marking the lowest since June, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, short of the 0.4% increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. However, core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.2% in October, accelerating from 0.1% in September. ""Due to the Golden Week holiday in October, the effect of stimulus policies on promoting domestic demand issued since late September is not obvious yet,"" said Bruce Pang, chief economist at JLL. He expected CPI to maintain an upward trend while core inflation remains mild, opening up space for the authorities to cut interest rates further early next year. China's central bank in late September unveiled the most aggressive monetary support measures since the COVID-19 pandemic to revive economic growth. The highly anticipated stimulus plan passed on Friday by the standing committee of the National People's Congress may leave investors who speculated on a fiscal bazooka disappointed, as it fell short of expectations for strong policy steps to boost consumption and reflate the economy. Finance Minister Lan Foan indicated on Friday that more stimulus was coming, telling a press conference that tax policies to support the housing market would come soon and that the authorities were accelerating the work of recapitalising banks. Some analysts say Beijing may want to retain some economic ammunition until Donald Trump resumes the US presidency in January. On a month-on-month basis, China's CPI dropped 0.3%, versus an unchanged outcome in September and below a forecast 0.1% decline. Declining food prices dragged down the month-on-month CPI, Dong Lijuan of the statistics bureau said in a statement. With 70% of Chinese household wealth tied up in the ailing real estate sector, which at its peak made up a quarter of the economy, consumers are holding onto their money tightly, subjecting the economy to deflationary pressures. China's headline consumer inflation will likely remain low next year at 0.8%, while producer prices will not turn positive until the third quarter of 2025, Goldman Sachs said in a note this month. Producer prices slid 2.9% on year in October, deeper than the 2.8% fall the previous month and below an expected 2.5% decline. It marked the biggest drop in 11 months. Factory-gate deflation deepened in the petroleum and natural gas extraction, oil and coal processing, chemical products manufacturing and auto manufacturing sectors. ""The implementation of some better-than-expected counter-cyclical adjustment policies is expected to improve consumption and investment momentum,"" said Zhou Maohua, a macroeconomic researcher at China Everbright Bank. ""But a recovery in the domestic housing market, household consumption and a balance of supply and demand would require some time."""

The stock gained 29% this week, adding more than $230 billion in market capitalization, its best since January 2023. ""Tesla and CEO Elon Musk are perhaps the biggest winners from the election result, and we believe Trump's victory will help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology,"" said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. The billionaire could push for favorable regulation of autonomous vehicles that Tesla plans and also get the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to hold off on potential enforcement actions involving the safety of Tesla's current driver-assistance systems, a source had told Reuters. Musk has focused on self-driving vehicle technology, ditching plans to build an economy car priced at under $30,000. However, development and regulatory hurdles have delayed the commercialization of such technologies. ""If Musk can convince Trump to establish federal autonomous vehicle rules, we think that's a good thing for the auto industry because we think firms want one set of rules rather than each state making their own,"" said David Whiston, equity strategist at Morningstar. Musk's wealth topped $300 billion, according to Forbes real-time billionaires list.

In the industrial sector, where electricity rates range between Rs31.79 to Rs41.12 per unit, the new rates will bring down the cost to Rs26.07 per unit, offering savings between Rs5.72 to Rs15.05 per unit for businesses. Similarly, commercial consumers will benefit from a reduced rate of Rs26.07 per unit for additional usage, cutting their current electricity bills, which range from Rs39.53 to Rs48.78 per unit, by up to Rs13.46 to Rs22.71 per unit.

"186","Business","US weekly jobless claims rise marginally","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323693-us-weekly-jobless-claims-rise-marginally","The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, suggesting no material change in the labour market and reinforcing views that hurricanes and strikes had resulted in job growth almost stalling in October. Though the labour market is easing, wage pressures are not showing a significant cooling, casting a shadow over the inflation and interest rate outlook. Unit labour costs increased at a solid clip in the third quarter, other data from the Labour Department showed on Thursday. Economists said the strong rise in labour costs, which was accompanied by a sharp upward revision to the second-quarter data, was not compatible with inflation returning and staying at the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The US central bank on Thursday cut interest rates by 25 basis points as expected, lowering its policy rate to the 4.50%-4.75% range. “Unit labour costs growth is the single biggest determinant of labor-intensive core services prices,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. “Unless unit labour costs growth slows again, it will be a lot harder for Fed officials to claim that inflation can be sustained at 2%.” Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended Nov 2, the Labour Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 221,000 claims for the latest week. Unadjusted claims rose 10,827 to 212,274 last week, boosted by a 4,278 jump in filings in California. Applications rose by 3,563 in Michigan and shot up 1,927 in Ohio, more than offsetting notable drops in Florida and Georgia. Employment growth slowed sharply last month, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by only 12,000 jobs, the fewest since December 2020. That aligned with a surge in claims in early October as Hurricane Helene disrupted economic activity in the US Southeast region. Applications stayed elevated through the middle of last month after Hurricane Milton lashed Florida. A strike by factory workers at Boeing, which forced the plane-maker to implement rolling furloughs, also weighed on payrolls in October. The disruptions from the hurricanes have almost faded, and the striking workers have gone back to work after agreeing to a new contract this week, paving the way for an acceleration in job growth in November. “New claims are signalling the weak October payroll print was likely an aberration driven by storms and strikes and that we should see a rebound in November,” said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at JPMorgan. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, rose 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.892 million during the week ending Oct. 26, the claims report showed. “The settlement of the Boeing strike will bring down the number of continuing claims as soon as next week's report,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “There is no call for radical monetary easing in today's figures, or in any labour market indicator for that matter.” The Fed embarked on its policy easing cycle with an unusually large half-percentage-point rate cut in September, the first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020. It hiked rates by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to curb high inflation. Stocks on Wall Street traded higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note retreated from four-month highs as investors continued to digest Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election that has fuelled fears his economic policies could stoke inflation. Concerns about inflation were amplified by a separate report from the Labour Department's Bureau of Labour Statistics showing unit labour costs - the price of labour per single unit of output - increased at a solid 1.9% annualized rate in the July-September quarter after an upwardly revised 2.4% pace of expansion in the second quarter. Economists had forecast labour costs rising at a 1.0% rate, after a previously reported 0.4% pace of increase in the second quarter. The revisions reflected annual upgrades to national accounts data published in September, which showed stronger income and overall economic growth than previously estimated. Labour costs increased at a 3.4% rate from a year ago, up from a 3.2% pace in the second quarter. They were, however, revised down by 0.6 percentage point to 2.2% in 2023. They increased 5.1% in 2022, down from the previously reported 5.7%. But they have picked up this year. “Chairman (Jerome) Powell and others at the Fed have essentially declared that the labour market is no longer an upward influence on inflation,” said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets. “These data suggest that this sanguine view may be a bit premature.” Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 2.2% rate last quarter after a downwardly revised 2.1% growth pace in the April-June quarter. Productivity was previously estimated to have increased at a 2.5% rate in the second quarter. It increased at a 2.0% pace from a year ago. Productivity grew at a 1.9% rate from the first quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2024, revised up from the previously estimated 1.7% pace, in tandem with the upgrades to GDP data. It was revised higher in each of the past three years, and is helping to underpin the economy. “Businesses are continuing to invest in technologies that will make their existing workers more productive,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial. “Over the longer run, artificial intelligence holds tremendous potential for boosting productivity growth.”"

SIFC has given the Petroleum Division directions for the refinery upgrade projects, with a vital step in the establishment of the hydrocracker unit at PARCO. This segment is designed to transform furnace oil into high-value petroleum products, such as petrol and diesel. According to the project, the authorities foresee the hydrocracker unit as a billion-dollar investment that will be sufficient money. This was confirmed by the statement issued by the refineries that they have made a move to the government requesting them to be super generous on sales tax for petrol and diesel products, which are vital to the overall energy sector. The recent amendments to the sales tax ordinance are SIFC's demonstration of their dedication to investment in the sector. The Sales Tax Act 1990, which now covers all goods and services, is in the process of being amended to allow for these changes. Developers of energy now predict that the sector's innovative solutions will be, under the umbrella of SIFC's new strategies, a more important contributor to Pakistan's financial stability."

The initiative has aimed to boost food and milk production in the country through the introduction of advanced farming technologies and practices. Under the new partnership, the government will receive technical assistance from Australia to implement cutting-edge technologies in crop production. This includes the introduction of high-quality seeds, modern grain storage methods, and improved farming techniques. The goal is to increase per-acre crop yields, which will play a vital role in strengthening Pakistan’s food security. To support this transformation, the government has allocated a staggering 400 billion Pakistani rupees, which will be used to fund various initiatives. Among these are the introduction of the ‘Kisan Card’ for farmers, a green tractor initiative, and solar energy projects aimed at making agriculture more sustainable. These steps are expected to enhance efficiency in crop production and improve the livelihoods of farmers across the country. Additionally, the government is investing Rs20billion in livestock development projects. These include the launch of a ‘Livestock Farmer Card’ and a comprehensive strategy to control and prevent livestock diseases. A key goal of this initiative is to ensure the export of disease-free meat, with a target of breeding 400,000 calves to strengthen the livestock sector. As part of efforts to restore ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity, Australian technology will also be deployed in forest monitoring using drones and public awareness campaigns aimed at protecting wildlife. In the field of aquaculture, a pilot project focused on shrimp farming has been launched, utilizing Australian expertise. Set to cover 100 acres, this project is expected to yield around 100 tons of shrimp annually, further bolstering Pakistan's aquatic food production. Moreover, as part of smog control efforts, the government is set to provide five billion rupees worth of modern machinery to farmers. This will help manage crop residues, particularly rice stubble, and reduce pollution from agricultural waste. The collaboration between Pakistan and Australia, facilitated by the SIFC, is poised to introduce crucial advancements in the agricultural sector, with benefits ranging from improved crop yields to enhanced food security and environmental sustainability. These measures are expected to contribute significantly to the country's economic stability and long-term development."

"192","Business","Automakers brace for new tariffs, EV changes under Trump","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323638-automakers-brace-for-new-tariffs-ev-changes-under-trump","Automakers are bracing for president-elect Donald Trump to impose new tariffs on vehicles from Mexico and potentially from other countries and to reverse many existing pro-electric vehicle policies, industry associations and executives said. Trump has said he plans to begin rescinding Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department vehicle rules on his first day in office and is considering paring back or eliminating EV tax breaks and other incentives. Those regulatory changes could give automakers more flexibility to build more profitable gas-powered SUVs and trucks but raise questions about the future of billions of dollars in EV battery and manufacturing spending. The Zero Emission Transportation Association, which includes Tesla, Rivian, Lucid and battery maker LG, said on Wednesday it was ready to work with Trump. The ""next four years are critical to ensuring that these technologies are developed and deployed by American workers in American factories for generations,"" it added. Tesla shares closed nearly 15% higher on Wednesday as investors bet it stood to benefit from its CEO Elon Musk's close ties with Trump. The American Trucking Associations on Wednesday called on Trump to replace the EPA's tighter tailpipe emissions with national emission standards that were ""technologically achievable and account for the operational realities of our essential industry."" Trump plans to rescind California's ability to set its own vehicle emissions rules, as he did in 2019. President Joe Biden reinstated California's authority. Trump will also decide how to spend billions of dollars in EV charging grants. Trump has repeatedly warned he will impose tariffs of 200% or more on vehicles imported from Mexico and could also impose them on Asian and European vehicles. Trump wants to prevent Chinese auto imports, but is open to Chinese automakers building vehicles in the United States. ""We're going to give incentives, and if China and other countries want to come here and sell the cars, they're going to build plants here, and they're going to hire our workers,"" Trump told Reuters in August. Mark Williams, president of site selection firm Strategic Development Group, expects to see greater demand for his company, but said tariffs will likely result in higher costs. ""If you're going to cut China out of our manufacturing system of pieces and parts that feed into automakers and you don't have a Mexico or somewhere else, I just don't know how much of it you can do in the U.S.,"" he said. ""I think we need Mexico more than ever if China is getting cut off."" South Korea's trade minister said Wednesday he expected companies from his country to invest more in the United States if Trump imposes higher tariffs. Honda's production capacity in Mexico is about 200,000 vehicles annually and 80% are exported to the U.S. market, chief operating officer Shinji Aoyama said. If the US were to impose permanent tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico, Aoyama said Honda would have to think about shifting production. Toyota builds Tacoma trucks at two plants in Mexico and sold more than 230,000 of the model in the United States last year. A person close to Toyota said steep tariffs by Trump on Mexican imports could prompt the automaker to move production of a vehicle like the Tacoma to San Antonio, Texas. A Toyota spokesperson declined to comment."

The Dow Industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each ended at record levels with investors expecting lower taxes, deregulation and a US president who is not shy to weigh in on everything from the stock market to the dollar, although fresh tariffs could bring challenges in the form of a higher deficit and inflation. The Republican's win powered a rally in so-called ""Trump trades,"" sending US Treasury yields sharply higher, with the benchmark 10-year note yield hitting a four-month high of 4.479%. Bitcoin hit a record high of over $76,000 and the dollar was on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since September 2022. Polls indicated a very tight race, with some concern the process could be drawn out before a victor was declared. ""Investors were kind of portfolio jockeying to score up some of their risk exposure in anticipation of an outcome that was going into it, seemingly a toss-up,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ""And obviously, it turned very quickly and led to a very much risk-on day today in which anything that isn't tied to the ground from a cyclical or pro-growth standpoint is absolutely launching."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,508.05 points, or 3.57%, to 43,729.93, the S&P 500 gained 146.28 points, or 2.53%, to 5,929.04 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 544.29 points, or 2.95%, to 18,983.47. Both the Dow and S&P 500 registered their biggest one-day percentage gains since November 2022. The Nasdaq notched its biggest daily percentage gain since February. Financials jumped 6.16% as the best performing of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors. Banks, expected to benefit from loosening regulations under Trump, powered the gains, with the S&P 500 bank index up 10.68%, its biggest daily jump in two years. The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 5.84%, its biggest surge since November 2022, to a three-year high, with the domestically concentrated stocks seen as likely to benefit from easier regulations, lower taxes and less exposure to import tariffs. However, rising Treasury yields could hurt smaller companies, which tend to rely heavily on borrowing and are more sensitive to higher interest rates. ""This move up in interest rates ... if it doesn't stall out here somewhere around this 4.4%, 4.5% level or so, and we start to retest those levels we saw last October of 5%, that could not only put small caps, but the market itself on its heels,"" said Luschini. The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street's ""Fear Gauge,"" dropped 4.22 points to close at a six-week low of 16.27. Rate-sensitive real estate shares, down 2.64%, and utilities, off 0.98%, were among the day's few declining sectors as investors assessed the chances of Trump's policies boosting inflation and altering the Federal Reserve's path of interest rates, which has been a key component of Wall Street's recent rally. The central bank is widely expected to ease the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at its policy-setting meeting ending on Thursday. However, traders have begun to trim bets for a cut in December and the number of reductions expected next year, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Stocks viewed as likely to perform well under a second Trump term also advanced, with Trump Media & Technology Group closing up 5.94% after a volatile session, while Tesla leaped 14.75% as CEO Elon Musk has supported Trump's reelection campaign. Strong gains were also made by shares of cryptocurrency companies, energy firms and prison operators, while renewable energy shares fell. Markets were also eyeing whether the Republican Party could maintain a majority in the House of Representatives after gaining control of the US Senate, which would lead to less opposition to a Trump agenda. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.51-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.84-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted 138 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 456 new highs and 115 new lows.

With Donald Trump being elected as the next US president, his pre-election pledge to impose tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% is likely to spur a shift in stocks to warehouses in China's No 1 export market. Trump's tariff threat is rattling Chinese factory owners and officials, with some $500 billion worth of shipments annually on the line, while trade tensions with the EU, which last year took $466 billion worth of Chinese goods, have intensified. Export momentum has been one bright spot for a struggling economy as household and business confidence has been dented by a prolonged property market debt crisis. Outbound shipments from China grew 12.7% year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Thursday, blowing past a forecast 5.2% increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 2.4% rise in September. Imports fell 2.3%, compared with expectations for a drop of 1.5%, turning negative for the first time in four months. ""We can anticipate a lot of front-loading going into the fourth quarter, before the pressure kicks in come 2025,"" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""I think it is mainly down to Trump. The threat is becoming more real."" China's exports to the US increased an annual 8.1% last month, while outbound shipments to Europe jumped 12.7% over the same period. ""We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months,"" Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. ""Any potential drag from Trump tariffs may not materialise until the second half of next year."" ""Trump's return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as US importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs,"" she added. Trade data from South Korea and Taiwan pointed to cooling global demand, while German manufacturers have also reported they are struggling to find buyers overseas, leading analysts to conclude Chinese producers are slashing prices to find buyers or simply moving stocks out of China. An official factory activity survey for October showed Chinese factories were still struggling to find buyers overseas. ""If the PMI new export sub-index has been going down, and the export figure goes up, I think it is safe to say it's more of an inventory shift,"" said Dan Wang, a Chinese economist based in Shanghai. Exporters also had help from a positive turn in the weather, enabling them to send out delayed orders. Typhoon Bebinca brought Shanghai to a standstill for one day in September, causing severe disruption to one of China's busiest ports. In the eastern province of Jiangsu a violent tornado killed at least 10 people and several other regions suffered heavy rain and strong winds, disrupting production. Natural disasters cost China 230 billion yuan ($32.23 billion) in direct economic losses over the third quarter, according to data from the Ministry of Emergency Management. Economists have cautioned Chinese policymakers against becoming too reliant on outbound shipments for growth and urged officials to introduce more stimulus. Analysts are now turning their attention to a $1.4 trillion fiscal package officials are likely to sign off on this week, which they expect to stabilise local government and property developers' balance sheets and ease the strains that have weighed on consumption. China's trade surplus came in at $95.27 billion last month, up from $81.71 billion in September."

Among them is 19-year-old Hafeez Mohammad Hossain, a student whose right hand was blown off during police gunfire on August 5, the day demonstrators stormed Hasina's palace. “I’ll be able to do some everyday tasks with this artificial hand,” Hossain said on Thursday as he tested the rubber-covered prosthetic limb, developed by Robolife Technologies, a Bangladeshi organization specializing in advanced artificial hands. The prosthetic hands use nerve-connected sensors, enabling users to perform basic functions such as holding a glass, typing, or using a phone. While far from mimicking organic hands, these limbs bring a sense of normalcy back to the lives of the injured. – A Tragic Backdrop – Hossain recounted the harrowing day when gun pellets tore through his body. ""A police officer pointed a shotgun at me and fired,"" he said. While surgeons managed to remove the gunshot fragments, they could not save his hand. The months-long protests against Hasina's autocratic regime claimed at least 700 lives in police crackdowns, leaving countless others wounded. – New Lives, New Challenges – Robolife Technologies, supported by the interim government, fitted prosthetics for five protesters on Thursday, including Hossain. “If you ask me whether they work like organic hands, I’d say no,” said Antu Karim, an engineer with the project. “But these hands can help the boys eat, drink, or perform simple tasks, restoring dignity.” Among the other recipients is 32-year-old Mohammad Mamun Mia, a father of two whose hand was severed by a gang allegedly linked to Hasina's Awami League party. While Mia can no longer work as a tractor driver, he now hopes to open a small business. Nineteen-year-old Arif Hossain Sagar, who lost his hand to amputation after a protest injury, and Nayeem Hasan, wounded while helping injured demonstrators, also received prosthetics. Hasan, who broke into tears, expressed hope the arm would help him hold his one-year-old daughter for the first time in months. – Calls for Support – Despite the hope these advancements bring, many injured protesters claim they lack sufficient aid. Earlier this month, limbless protesters rallied, urging the interim government to prioritize their needs. Hasina's 15-year tenure was marked by allegations of human rights abuses, including mass detentions and extrajudicial killings. For survivors like Hossain and Mia, the prosthetics signify a chance to rebuild, though scars of the past remain deeply etched."

While iOS 15 had already added Voice Isolation and Wide Spectrum to FaceTime calls, this feature was expanded to regular phone calls in iOS 16.4, allowing users to enjoy more focused, high-quality communication. Now, with the latest update in October—iOS 18.1—Apple continues to refine its software, enhancing the functionality of these features and further improving call quality. Voice Isolation works by muffling unwanted background noise, such as barking dogs, traffic, or even construction sounds, ensuring that your voice remains the focus of the conversation. Whether you're on a business call or catching up with friends, the feature allows for a more professional and clear communication experience. It’s incredibly easy to activate. Simply follow these steps while on an active call: Once activated, Voice Isolation remains on for all future calls until manually turned off, making it a convenient feature for regular users. To disable the feature, repeat the process and tap Standard in Phone Controls to return to the default microphone settings. Alongside Voice Isolation, Apple also introduced the Wide Spectrum mode, but this feature is currently only available for FaceTime calls. In contrast to Voice Isolation, which focuses on eliminating background noise, Wide Spectrum amplifies surrounding sounds while preserving the clarity of your voice. This is particularly useful for group calls, where multiple voices need to be heard clearly without distortion. At present, Wide Spectrum is still limited to FaceTime calls, but its presence in the Phone Controls suggests that Apple may introduce it for regular phone calls in the future. Apple’s continuous refinement of iOS indicates an ongoing commitment to improving user experience, especially when it comes to communication tools. As more features are added, users can expect a higher level of clarity and convenience during phone calls. With the integration of Voice Isolation and potentially Wide Spectrum for all calls, iPhone users will benefit from a more seamless and professional communication experience. For now, those looking to improve the quality of their calls will want to make sure their device is updated to iOS 16.4 or later. Stay tuned for future updates, including the possibilities of expanded features in iOS 18.2."

Until now, YouTube's Dream Screen tool offered only image-based backgrounds for short videos. However, with the integration of Google DeepMind's advanced video-generation model, Veo, Dream Screen can now create animated video backgrounds in high-definition, offering new possibilities for creators to elevate their content. The feature, available to users in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, enables users to generate custom backgrounds by simply entering a text prompt. To use the Dream Screen feature, creators need to open the Shorts camera, tap the green screen icon, and select Dream Screen. From there, they can input any text prompt, choose an animation style, and hit ""Create."" YouTube's AI will then generate a variety of video backgrounds based on the provided prompt. Users can choose their preferred background, shoot their video, and have the AI-generated backdrop seamlessly incorporated into their content. This innovative tool opens up a world of creative possibilities. Whether users want to film themselves in a magical forest, recreate scenes from popular books and movies, or design an elaborate opening sequence for a video series, Dream Screen offers unparalleled flexibility. YouTube has hinted at future updates that will include six-second standalone video clips, allowing for even more diverse video background options. Unlike its competitors, such as TikTok, YouTube's new video background feature stands out by offering cinematic-quality, 1080p visuals. This addition is part of YouTube's broader strategy to leverage AI across the platform, with other tools such as ""Brainstorm with Gemini"" helping creators find new video ideas, and AI-driven solutions addressing copyright challenges by removing music without taking down videos entirely. While the Dream Screen feature is not yet available globally, YouTube has indicated plans to expand it to more regions in the near future. For creators looking to take their Shorts to the next level, Dream Screen promises to be a game-changer in the world of video content creation."

The breach was announced on Thursday when the group flooded the private chatrooms of the website with pro-feminist emojis and transgender pride flags, sending a clear message against Tate’s ideological stance. The hackers also uploaded a satirical AI-generated image of Tate, with exaggerated features, draped in a transgender pride flag. According to reports by Daily Dot, Tate was streaming on the right-wing platform Rumble while his website's primary chatroom was overtaken. Tate’s online university, which charges $49.99 per month for courses designed to teach subscribers how to make money through online marketing, e-commerce, and cryptocurrency trading, has a significant following. Despite facing legal troubles in Romania—where he is under house arrest while authorities investigate allegations of sex crimes, human trafficking, and money laundering—Tate's platform claims to have over 113,000 active subscribers, generating millions in revenue. However, the hackers, describing their actions as an act of hacktivism, revealed the vulnerability of the site, claiming it was ""hilariously insecure."" The group gained access to ""The Real World"" platform, where they were able to upload emojis, delete attachments, crash clients, and temporarily ban users. Additionally, they stole sensitive data, including 794,000 usernames belonging to both current and former members of the site, as well as 324,382 email addresses of users who had either been removed from the platform or had failed to pay their subscription fees. The breach also led to the hackers copying contents from 221 public and 395 private chat servers, further compromising the privacy of users’ communications. In response, Tate’s fans are being urged to check if their data was compromised by visiting ""Have I Been Pwned,"" a website that tracks data breaches. While this incident highlights the vulnerabilities of platforms associated with high-profile figures, it also brings to the forefront ongoing concerns regarding data security and privacy in the digital age. As investigations into the breach continue, Tate’s platform faces scrutiny not only from the hacking group but also from his millions of online followers."
"207","Science-Technology","Apple rolls out new tools for secure password generation on iPhones","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324474-apple-rolls-out-new-tools-for-secure-password-generation-on-iphones","Apple has taken a significant step toward enhancing password security by introducing multiple ways for iPhone users to generate secure passwords, providing greater flexibility and accessibility. While the tech giant is pushing for a passwordless future with innovations like Passkeys, the need for strong and secure passwords remains crucial. The new methods leverage the Passwords app and Siri Shortcuts, offering solutions that cater to different user needs, including those operating unsupported versions of iOS. This development aligns with Apple’s ongoing efforts to simplify cybersecurity for its global user base. With the release of iOS 18, Apple’s new Passwords app provides an integrated, user-friendly tool for generating secure passwords on the fly. The app eliminates some of the limitations associated with iCloud Keychain, offering a no-frills solution for those who prefer straightforward functionality. To generate a password using the Passwords app, follow these steps: Users can further customize entries by adding website labels, usernames, or notes. For those who require multiple suggestions, tapping on another text field and then returning to the password field will generate a new option. While this method is efficient, it primarily suits users who want to save credentials within the app or create passwords quickly without requiring advanced features. For those seeking more flexibility, Apple has introduced a clever workaround using the Siri Shortcuts app. By downloading the pre-configured ""Generate Password"" shortcut via an iCloud link, users can create strong passwords with minimal effort. The shortcut generates Apple-style passwords—20 characters long, including hyphens, uppercase letters, and numbers. This approach caters to users who might prefer accessing password generation tools directly from different locations on their device. How to Use the Shortcut: Upon running the shortcut, users receive a password that is automatically copied to the clipboard. A notification displays the generated password, which expires from the clipboard after 10 minutes for security reasons. These new methods reflect Apple’s commitment to bridging the gap between user convenience and robust security. The Passwords app offers a straightforward, built-in solution, while the Siri Shortcut caters to advanced users seeking flexibility across multiple access points. As passwords remain a critical aspect of online security, these tools equip iPhone and iPad users with the resources they need to maintain secure digital identities. While Apple’s push for a passwordless future continues, these innovations underscore the tech giant’s dedication to addressing current cybersecurity challenges effectively."

Since its debut in 2004, WoW has become a cultural phenomenon, attracting millions of players worldwide and evolving with the changing gaming landscape. The game’s director, Ion Hazzikostas, spoke at the Gamescom trade show in Germany, reflecting on the game's rare longevity and the pressure of maintaining its legacy. ""It is inspiring to be able to work on this rare game that has touched so many lives, and to also feel the burden of carrying that forward,"" Hazzikostas said. As a fan of WoW from the beginning, Hazzikostas joined Blizzard Entertainment, the game's California-based developer, in 2008, where he rose through the ranks to become its current director. Although WoW wasn’t the first MMORPG, it quickly became an international hit, drawing players in with its rich fantasy world and social experience. WoW has long been recognized for its social appeal, as players join guilds and communities, interacting with one another in a shared virtual space. According to Olivier Servais, a specialist in online communities, Blizzard pioneered an engaging social experience by focusing on small, human-scale guilds. This environment, where players could form relationships, share personal stories, and even organize events like weddings, became a precursor to the social networks we use today. At its peak in the 2010s, WoW boasted over 10 million active accounts, though the real number may be higher due to account sharing, particularly in Asia. Although Blizzard no longer reveals player statistics, the game maintains its popularity across the globe. Despite its longevity, WoW remains in a constant state of evolution. The release of its 10th expansion, ""The War Within,"" in August brought fresh content and areas to explore, further proving that the game is far from fading into the background of gaming history. ""We are not resting on our laurels,"" Hazzikostas emphasized. ""We are trying new ambitious things to shake up what we've done and keep that vibrant."" He likened WoW's ongoing evolution to other long-running franchises like Marvel and Star Wars, signaling that there is no end in sight for the beloved game. As WoW continues to celebrate its legacy, its impact on the gaming community and the social fabric of the digital world remains undeniable. Whether through its groundbreaking approach to online communities or its enduring popularity, ""World of Warcraft"" has cemented its place in gaming history."

However, rather than offering direct discounts, the tech giant will once again provide customers with bundled Apple Gift Cards ranging from $25 to $200, depending on the product. The promotion allows buyers to use the gift card for future Apple purchases, which could benefit customers planning to buy multiple items. However, critics note the lack of outright price cuts, particularly as rival retailers have rolled out significant discounts on Apple products. The 2024 Black Friday gift card promotions apply selectively across Apple’s product range. Key details include: Several popular items are conspicuously absent from the promotion, with no gift cards offered for: These omissions come as other retailers, including Amazon, step in with compelling alternatives. For instance, Amazon is offering up to $100 off the new M4 Mac mini, alongside discounts on other devices. While Apple's approach may appeal to brand loyalists, critics argue it pales in comparison to direct discounts offered by third-party sellers. These competitive deals often sell out quickly, adding urgency for bargain hunters seeking the best value for money. Apple is unlikely to alter its gift card strategy, though additional items could potentially be added to the promotional list before Black Friday kicks off. For now, customers seeking tangible savings may find better deals with resellers.

An uptick in total sales in Spain and Germany, of 7.2% and 6% respectively, offset a contraction in France, Italy, and Britain, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said. European automakers are struggling with weak demand, high production costs, and managing the shift to EVs, while trying to fend off competition from China. The number of new vehicles registered in October in the EU, Britain, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) rose 0.1% year-on-year to 1.04 million. Sales of fully electric cars (BEVs) rose for the second consecutive month, up 6.9% in October, while those of hybrid cars (HEVs) rose by 15.8%. Registrations in the EU, Britain, and EFTA at Volkswagen rose 12.6%, while they fell by 16.7% at Stellantis and by 0.4% at Renault. Sales were down 23.1% at EV maker Tesla and down 10% at China's SAIC Motor. In the EU, total new car registrations rose 1.1% year-on-year.

The brain chip startup said the Canadian study aims to assess the safety and initial functionality of its implant which enables people with quadriplegia, or paralysis of all four limbs, to control external devices with their thoughts. Canada's University Health Network hospital said in a separate statement that its Toronto facility had been selected to perform the complex neurosurgical procedure. Regulator Health Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the United States, Neuralink has already implanted the device in two patients. The company says the device is working well in the second trial patient, who has been using it to play video games and learn how to design 3D objects. Founded in 2016 by Musk and a group of engineers, Neuralink is also building a brain chip interface that can be implanted within the skull, which it says could eventually help disabled patients to move and communicate again, and restore vision.

This surge in growth highlights Bluesky’s remarkable momentum, with the platform having added 5 million users in under a week, compared to just 15 million users the week before. The app's user base has nearly tripled in the last three months, signaling its rising popularity in the competitive social media space. The increase in users has been notably rapid, with Bluesky registering days where it gained up to one million new users in just 24 hours. In comparison, Meta’s Threads app, which reached 275 million monthly active users earlier this month, has been seeing a similar daily sign-up rate for nearly three months, according to Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram. Despite the gains, Bluesky still remains significantly smaller than platforms like Threads and X. Bluesky's position in the app rankings is further evidence of its popularity. The platform has dominated the top spots in both Apple’s App Store and Google Play, holding the number one position in the App Store for six consecutive days and securing the top spot for non-gaming apps on Google Play for four days. In contrast, Threads currently ranks second in the App Store. The surge in Bluesky’s user base has been partly attributed to dissatisfaction with X, formerly known as Twitter. On November 7, Bluesky experienced a notable spike in traffic, the day after the U.S. presidential election, as many users of X sought alternatives or deactivated their accounts in response to dissatisfaction with the platform. Bluesky’s commitment to privacy and user-focused policies may also be fueling its rise. The platform has emphasized its pledge not to use user content for training generative AI models, a practice that X permits. Additionally, Bluesky's CEO, Jay Graber, has made it clear that the platform intends to remain free of intrusive ads, distinguishing itself from Threads, which plans to introduce advertising in January 2024. As Bluesky continues to gain traction, its decentralized structure and user-first approach are carving out a unique space in the social media landscape, attracting users looking for alternatives to the dominant platforms like X and Threads."

US District Judge Julien Neals in Newark, New Jersey, is scheduled to hear arguments from lawyers for Apple, and from prosecutors who say the company locks users in and keeps competition out by limiting interoperability between the iPhone and third-party apps and devices. Apple has moved to dismiss the case, saying its limitations on developers' access to its technology were reasonable, and that forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation. Antitrust cases against Big Tech firms are a bipartisan trend. The case against Apple began during the first presidential term of Donald Trump and was filed during the administration of President Joe Biden. In other cases, Alphabet's Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in online search, Meta Platforms faces trial on claims that it squelched competition by acquiring upstart rivals, and Amazon.com is fighting a case over its policies toward sellers and suppliers. But some claims like the ones at the heart of the Apple case have ultimately failed. A judge dismissed the Federal Trade Commission's claim against Meta over the social media platform's restrictions on third-party app developers. In the Google search case, the judge rejected a claim that Google should have done more to accommodate advertisers on Microsoft's search engine, Bing. Apple cited the ruling in its own case, saying it shows that withholding access to technology should not be considered anticompetitive. The Apple lawsuit filed in March by the DOJ and a coalition of states takes aim at restrictions and fees on app developers, and technical roadblocks to third-party devices and services - such as smart watches, digital wallets and messaging services - that would compete with its own. If the judge finds the claims plausible, the case will be allowed to move forward."

What’s driving this historic surge?","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324277-bitcoin-breaks-94-000-what-s-driving-this-historic-surge","Bitcoin has breached the $94,000 mark for the first time in history, fueled by growing optimism surrounding the potential acquisition of crypto trading firm Bakkt by Donald Trump’s media company. This surge marks a significant milestone for the world’s leading cryptocurrency, which has more than doubled in value this year. As of Wednesday morning in Asia, Bitcoin was trading at $92,104, after briefly touching a record high of $94,078 in the previous session. The dramatic rise follows a report by the Financial Times, citing sources with knowledge of the matter, which revealed that Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, is nearing an all-stock deal to acquire Bakkt, a crypto trading platform backed by the NYSE’s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange. Market analysts are attributing Bitcoin’s record-breaking surge to this report, which has sparked renewed enthusiasm among traders. Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, noted that the Trump-related news, combined with the launch of options trading on Nasdaq and the backing of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, has created a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s rise. The growing euphoria surrounding cryptocurrencies has been further fuelled by a sense of optimism following the U.S. elections on November 5.Many traders are betting that President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets, a sentiment that has already boosted Bitcoin's value significantly in the past few weeks. Chris Weston, head of research at Australian online broker Pepperstone, echoed this sentiment, saying that there is genuine buying pressure behind Bitcoin’s rally. “Another push higher is expected, attracting new investors who are eager to buy into the strength of the market,” he said. The rise in Bitcoin prices has contributed to a broader rally in the cryptocurrency market, which has now surpassed a market valuation of $3 trillion, according to CoinGecko, a leading data aggregator. This surge highlights the growing confidence in digital assets, particularly as institutional interest in cryptocurrencies continues to expand. "

Must try this latest feature","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324263-fed-up-with-your-instagram-feed-must-try-this-latest-feature","Instagram -  the popular photo-sharing platform owned by Meta -  has introduced a new feature that gives users the ability to reset their content recommendations, providing a fresh start for those dissatisfied with their current feed. The update, announced by Instagram in a blog post on Tuesday, is aimed at offering more control to users over the algorithm that shapes their experience on the platform. The reset feature, located in the content preferences section of Instagram’s settings, allows users to activate the option and wipe the algorithm’s memory of their past interactions. By doing so, the algorithm ""forgets"" everything it knows about the user, enabling them to start receiving new, personalized content based on their updated interests. Customizing the feed Along with the reset option, Instagram advises users to review the accounts they follow and their ad preferences to prevent the algorithm from returning to the same suggestions that were previously unwanted. “Your recommendations will start to personalize again over time, showing new content based on the content and accounts you interact with,” Instagram said in its post.The feature is designed to allow users to have greater control over their content, especially if they feel that their interests have changed or if they wish to escape unwanted content.  This feature is particularly useful for teenagers, who may find themselves exposed to inappropriate or irrelevant content. In addition to the content reset, Instagram has long been working on measures to protect younger users, including enhanced safety features for teen accounts and tools to prevent sextortion. Meta has also developed AI-driven systems to ensure that minors are properly categorized, especially in cases where users may attempt to misrepresent their age. Teen protection in focus Instagram’s parent company Meta emphasized that the algorithm reset is part of its ongoing efforts to protect teens from harmful content. Meta has been under increasing scrutiny regarding the safety of young users on its platforms. In the same blog post, the company highlighted a new page in its Transparency Center, detailing how Instagram and Facebook work to keep teens safe by removing inappropriate content and hiding potentially harmful videos and images. “Your recommendations will start to personalize again over time, showing new content based on the content and accounts you interact with,” Instagram said. ""When resetting, you'll also have the option to review the accounts you're following and unfollow any that share content you no longer want to see."" In addition to content moderation, Meta also stated that there are certain types of content that Instagram will never recommend, even if they do not violate any of the platform's community guidelines. These types of content will only appear in a user’s feed if they actively seek it out. Wider impact on digital platforms The launch of Instagram's content reset feature comes at a time when other digital platforms are also enhancing protections for younger audiences. Social media platforms like Roblox and Fortnite have made changes to better control content and ensure the safety of younger users. Governments, too, are stepping in with new regulations to safeguard children. In Australia, for instance, a proposed social media ban would prevent children under 16 from accessing these platforms without parental approval."

According to a security advisory published on Apple’s website, the vulnerabilities are linked to WebKit and JavaScriptCore—the core engines responsible for powering the Safari browser and processing web content on Apple devices. WebKit, in particular, has long been a target for hackers attempting to exploit weaknesses to gain access to sensitive user data. Apple’s security team has emphasized that these flaws can be exploited by malicious actors, allowing them to trick affected Mac devices into executing harmful code through specially crafted websites or emails. This could result in the installation of malware and the potential compromise of personal information. While Apple has confirmed that the vulnerabilities have been used in active attacks, it has not disclosed the full extent of the damage. The identity of the attackers remains unknown, though the involvement of a state-backed cyberattack is being considered. Security researchers from Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which investigates government-backed cyberattacks, first reported the vulnerabilities, hinting that a nation-state actor could be responsible. The software update, which also includes fixes for iPhones and iPads running older versions of iOS 17, is recommended for all users. Although the exact number of affected devices is unclear, the vulnerabilities primarily impact devices running older Intel-based Mac processors, which are still used by a large portion of Apple’s customer base. Apple's decision to release updates across its operating systems, including macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, highlights the growing threats to users’ privacy and security in today’s highly interconnected digital landscape. The company has urged its users to install the updates as soon as possible to avoid any potential risks."

The project, which merges technology with spirituality, has been developed by the church in collaboration with the Immersive Realities Research Lab at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. The AI model was trained using the biblical scriptures, allowing it to simulate the persona and teachings of the 1st-century Galilean. Once inside the confessional, visitors are greeted by a Swiss-looking image of Jesus displayed on a screen. The AI listens to their questions or concerns, offering guidance inspired by the New Testament’s depiction of Christ. The creators of the project assert that the responses have aligned with the church's theological understanding of Jesus. Modern twist on faith ""AI fascinates us, but it also raises ethical questions,"" said Marco Schmid, a theologian at St. Peter's Chapel. He emphasized that the project was intended to explore how modern technology could be used for spiritual reflection. “In all previous tests, the AI’s responses have matched our theological understanding,” he noted. While the concept has sparked intrigue, reactions from those who have used the AI confessional have been mixed. One parishioner praised the system for its insightful advice, stating how surprised they were by the ease and relevance of the interaction. However, another visitor found the responses to be somewhat generic, suggesting that the machine's interpretations of spiritual guidance might not resonate with everyone. The project has ignited discussions about the role of AI in religious practices. Some see it as a modern bridge to faith, while others question the authenticity of such interactions. As the project continues, St. Peter's Chapel plans to refine its AI Jesus, but the ethical implications of using technology in such an intimate and spiritual context remain a point of concern. The church’s initiative has sparked interest in broader discussions on AI's place in religion, with some asking whether technology could replace traditional forms of divine interaction. In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, similar projects like Social AI, where AI characters simulate entire human experiences, and Friend.com, a platform for supporting AI personalities, are pushing the boundaries of virtual engagement. Yet, for many, the question remains: Can a machine truly replicate the transformative power of personal faith? As AI continues to challenge traditional beliefs, the church may soon find itself navigating a new frontier in both religious and technological ethics, raising the question: How far can we go in blending faith and artificial intelligence?"
"223","Science-Technology","Swedish app helps families organise household chores","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324252-swedish-app-helps-families-organise-household-chores","Swedish engineering students have launched the app to track and assign household tasks, aiming to reduce domestic workload disparities and foster family communication. In a bid to make ""invisible work visible"" and promote family harmony, Swedish engineering students have developed an app to help families organize and track household chores. The app, called *Accord*, allows users to input chores and monitor each other's progress, offering reminders when tasks aren't completed on time. The app, which has already attracted around 2,000 users, was created by engineering students Victor Fredrikson and Marcus Pahlman. It was born from a simple frustration: Fredrikson's father grew tired of reminding his son to tidy his room and do laundry. ""So finally, one day he said, 'Why don’t you just program an app so I don’t have to nag you anymore?'"" Fredrikson explained. The result was *Accord*, which launched in early September. Among the early adopters are Marko and Neha Sarcevic, a married couple from Stockholm's wealthy suburb of Täby. The couple, both business owners with two young children, turned to the app to streamline the often chaotic process of managing household tasks. ""We thought, okay, let’s try this out, maybe it can solve many of our issues at home,"" Neha said. For the Sarcevics, the app has sparked open discussions about shared responsibilities at home . ""It brought up the conversation at home,"" Marko noted, ""like, okay, if things aren't being done, who's responsible for them?"" Neha has enjoyed using the app, particularly its reminder feature, though she admits to not using it as often as she should. *Accord* is designed to make household work more transparent and foster appreciation for each member’s contributions. Family members can send ""reminders"" if tasks are not completed, and users can show gratitude when chores are finished. This system aims to address long-standing issues of gender inequality in domestic labor. A 2023 study by UN Women found that women worldwide spend 2.8 hours more on unpaid domestic work than men each day. The app’s creators hope it will spark more discussions about sharing household duties, reducing the gender gap, and making family chores a more collaborative and rewarding experience. ""We want people to talk about it more and be more involved in the family discussion,"" Fredrikson explained. Looking to the future, the Sarcevics plan to introduce the app to their children as they grow older. ""Clean the room, you get some points,"" Marko said, envisioning a system where the kids earn rewards—and possibly an allowance—for helping out around the house. Neha, who also employs an au pair to assist with childcare, finds the app helpful for managing her busy household. ""It makes my 'mum brain' a bit more relaxed,"" she said, appreciating the ability to stay updated on her children’s care without constant inquiries. The app’s goal is clear: reduce household tension, foster fairness in domestic responsibilities, and make the invisible labor of running a household more visible to everyone."

US District Judge Julien Neals in Newark, New Jersey, is scheduled to hear arguments from lawyers for Apple, and from prosecutors who say the company locks users in and keeps competition out by limiting interoperability between the iPhone and third-party apps and devices. Apple has moved to dismiss the case, saying its limitations on developers' access to its technology were reasonable, and that forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation. Antitrust cases against Big Tech firms are a bipartisan trend. The case against Apple began during the first presidential term of Donald Trump and was filed during the administration of President Joe Biden. In other cases, Alphabet's Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in online search, Meta Platforms faces trial on claims that it squelched competition by acquiring upstart rivals, and Amazon.com is fighting a case over its policies toward sellers and suppliers. But some claims like the ones at the heart of the Apple case have ultimately failed. A judge dismissed the Federal Trade Commission's claim against Meta over the social media platform's restrictions on third-party app developers. In the Google search case, the judge rejected a claim that Google should have done more to accommodate advertisers on Microsoft's search engine, Bing. Apple cited the ruling in its own case, saying it shows that withholding access to technology should not be considered anticompetitive. The Apple lawsuit filed in March by the DOJ and a coalition of states takes aim at restrictions and fees on app developers, and technical roadblocks to third-party devices and services - such as smart watches, digital wallets and messaging services - that would compete with its own. If the judge finds the claims plausible, the case will be allowed to move forward."

"228","Science-Technology","Australia to ban social media for children under 16","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323611-australia-to-ban-social-media-for-children-under-16","Australia’s government has announced plans to introduce landmark legislation that would prohibit children under 16 from using social media. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that the proposed law, which will be introduced in parliament next week, is aimed at reducing the ""harm"" social media poses to Australian children. ""This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,"" Albanese said. The details are still under discussion, but the government clarified that the ban will not apply to children already active on social media, and there will be no parental consent exemptions. Social media platforms will be responsible for proving they are taking reasonable steps to prevent underage access. Enforcement of the law will fall under Australia’s online regulator, the eSafety Commissioner, with no penalties for users. If passed, the legislation will take effect 12 months later and undergo a review afterward. Many experts agree that social media can harm adolescents’ mental health, though opinions vary on whether a ban is the best approach. Some believe bans only delay exposure to platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook rather than preparing young people to navigate online spaces safely. Similar restrictions have proven difficult in other regions, such as the European Union, where age-verification measures have faced challenges. Australia's Child Rights Taskforce, a major advocacy group, criticized the proposed law as ""too blunt"" and urged the government to consider ""safety standards"" instead. In an open letter, the group cited UN guidance recommending policies that enable children to safely engage with digital environments rather than restricting access. However, some campaigners support the ban, citing concerns about children’s exposure to harmful content, misinformation, and online bullying. The 36Months initiative, which has gathered over 125,000 signatures, argues children ""not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely"" until at least 16, and that currently ""excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness"". Asked if the focus should instead be on teaching children to manage the benefits and risks of the online world, Albanese argued that education alone is inadequate, as it ""assumes an equal power relationship."" ""I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,"" he said on Thursday. ""These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour."""

El Cosmico, an existing hotel and campground on the outskirts of the city of Marfa, is expanding. It is building 43 new hotel units and 18 residential homes over 40 acres (16 hectares) - all with a 3D printer. It is the world's first 3D-printed hotel, says El Cosmico owner Liz Lambert and the partners behind the project - Austin, Texas-based 3D printing company ICON and architects Bjarke Ingels Group. Lambert said the technology allows for unprecedented creativity. ""Most hotels are contained within four walls and a lot of times you are building the same unit over and over and over again,"" Lambert said. ""I've never been able to build with such little constraint and such fluidity ... just the curves, and the domes, and the parabolas. It's a crazy way to build."" The units can include architectural features that would normally be too expensive to replicate on a large scale with traditional construction, according to Lambert. The single-story, 12-foot (3.7-meter) high walls of the first two units under construction are a three-bedroom residential space and single-room hotel unit. The curvy, beige-colored walls are being piped out by ICON's Vulcan, a 46.5-feet (14.2 m) wide 3D printer standing 15.5 feet (4.7 m) and weighing 4.75 tons. A print technician monitors Vulcan as its robotic arm and nozzle glide through the work site on a gantry. The ""ink"" of this 3D printer is a special cement-based material called Lavacrete, a proprietary mixture designed for strength, affordable scale, and printability. ICON CEO and founder Jason Ballard said workers adjust and blend the ingredients based on weather conditions. ""The magic happens in the admixtures that allow us to continue printing,"" Ballard said, adding that humidity, temperature, and irradiance affect the material's behavior and even the final color.ICON is also working on a 3D-printed neighborhood of homes near Austin. In the long term, 3D-printed construction could displace some skilled laboring jobs, said Milad Bazli, a science and technology lecturer at Charles Darwin University in Australia. ""I think from the social point of view and the effect on the economy in terms of the local jobs, especially in remote areas, that will be one of the challenges that we need to consider when we're going to the 3D printing method,"" Bazli said. The expansion of El Cosmico is set to be completed by 2026. The hotel units will range between $200 and $450 per night."

The California company sketched out its aspirations for products that would bring the virtual world into the real one. ""This is the physical world with holograms overlaid on it,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said after pulling out the chunky black glasses from a metal case dramatically brought to him on stage. ""For now, I think the right way to look at Orion is as a time machine,"" he said. ""These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting."" Meta also showed off new AI chatbot capabilities for its services and a new Quest mixed-reality headset. Meta shares registered a record closing high on Wednesday, up 0.9% at $568.31. The Orion glasses are made of magnesium alloy and powered by custom silicon designed by Meta. Users will be able to interact with the glasses through hand-tracking, voice and wrist-based neural interface. Meta plans to work on making it smaller, sleeker and more low-cost before releasing it to consumers later on, Zuckerberg said. Big Tech has been developing AR devices for years, although the most notable ones have been failures, such as Google's Glass glasses. Zuckerberg positioned AR technology as a sort of magnum opus when he first pivoted the world’s biggest social media company toward building immersive “metaverse” systems in 2021. Delivering products, however, has been hampered by high development costs and technological hurdles. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said there was no doubt of Meta's aspiration to make virtual- and augmented-reality products as mass-market and affordable as possible. But he added that users were ""still wary of AI"" and needed some convincing. Meta aims to ship its first commercial AR glasses to consumers in 2027, by which point technical breakthroughs should bring down the cost of production, a source said before the event. Zuckerberg did not demonstrate Orion's capabilities directly during his announcement, instead playing a video showing how people reacted to the device when they tried it. The video showed a few glimpses of text messages and images displayed through the glasses, and the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, was prominent among the testers. The closest thing to the prototype currently is the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which initially inspired little interest but caught on last year after Meta added an AI assistant. Meta announced AI enhancements to those glasses this year, making it possible for users, for example, to scan QR codes and stream music from Spotify in response to voice prompts. Later this year, the company plans to add video-generation capabilities and the ability to perform real-time language translation between English and French, Italian or Spanish. Zuckerberg held a live conversation with Mexican mixed martial arts fighter Brandon Moreno demonstrating the language tool, in which the glasses spoke translations from English to Spanish and vice versa. Meta also announced a raft of other new product offerings for its ChatGPT-like chatbot, as well as plans to start automatically injecting personalized images created by the bot into people's Facebook and Instagram feeds. Among the AI updates announced was an audio upgrade to the digital assistant, called Meta AI, which will now respond to voice commands and offer users the option to make the assistant sound like celebrities including Judi Dench and John Cena. “I think that voice is going to be a way more natural way of interacting with AI than text,"" Zuckerberg said. The company said more than 400 million people are using Meta AI monthly, including 185 million who are returning to it weekly. In keeping with its strategy of sharing the AI models powering its digital agent for mostly free use by others, Meta released three new versions of its Llama 3 models, although it withheld the models from the European Union in light of regulations there. Meta also announced an entry-level version of its Quest line of mixed-reality headsets, the Quest 3S, which will start at $300, and cut the price of the Quest 3 introduced last year. The company has been plowing tens of billions of dollars into its investments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality and other metaverse technologies, driving up its capital expense forecast for 2024 to a record high of between $37 billion and $40 billion. Its metaverse unit Reality Labs lost $8.3 billion in the first half of this year, according to the most recent disclosures. It lost $16 billion last year."

"241","Science-Technology","Webb telescope reveals rapid growth of primordial black hole","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323559-webb-telescope-reveals-rapid-growth-of-primordial-black-hole","At the heart of our Milky Way galaxy lurks a supermassive black hole about four million times the mass of the sun, called Sagittarius A*. In fact, these objects, which increase in mass over time by eating material that wanders too close, reside at the center of most galaxies. But since NASA's James Webb Space Telescope came online in 2022, astronomers have been surprised to find supermassive black holes inhabiting the early universe - earlier than they had thought possible considering the time needed to gather such great mass. New observations of one such primordial black hole is offering insight into how this may have occurred - through episodes of supercharged growth. Black holes are extremely dense objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape. With their immense gravitational pull, they grow in mass by sucking in material such as gas, dust and stars unfortunate enough to stray nearby. ""The existence of supermassive black holes in the early universe challenges our current models of black hole formation and growth,"" said astronomer Hyewon Suh of the International Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and the U.S. National Science Foundation's NOIRLab, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy. The new Webb observations involve a supermassive black hole called LID-568 that existed when the cosmos was about 11% its current age - about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang event 13.8 billion years ago that initiated the universe. LID-568 has a mass about 10 million times greater than the sun, so 2-1/2 times that of Sagittarius A*. The researchers have not yet determined the mass of its home galaxy. LID-568 was observed gaining mass at a pace faster than previously thought possible. Webb showed that, based on its observed energetic output, LID-568 appeared to be consuming infalling material - known as accretion - at more than 40 times the hypothesized maximum, called the Eddington limit, for such activity. ""The Eddington limit is a theoretical limit for the maximum energy output the black hole can produce through the accretion process. This theoretical limit assumes that the outward force from the radiation produced during the accretion process balances the gravity of the infalling material,"" said astronomer and study co-author Julia Scharwächter of the Gemini Observatory and NOIRLab. These primordial black holes are thought to have originated in one of two ways, either following the explosive death of the universe's first generation of stars or through the collapse of large clouds of gas present in the early universe. ""The discovery of LID-568 suggests that a significant portion of mass growth can occur during a single episode of rapid accretion. This could help explain how supermassive black holes formed so early in the universe, regardless of how they originated,"" Suh said. ""Until now, we have lacked observational confirmation of how these black holes could grow so quickly in the early universe,"" Suh added. A key sign of a growing supermassive black hole is emission of X-rays, high-energy electromagnetic radiation with very short wavelengths. Material swirling around a supermassive black hole before it is consumed is superheated and glows strongly in X-ray wavelengths. The researchers first spotted LID-568 using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and then studied it more closely using Webb's infrared observational capabilities. The Webb observations suggest the existence of some sort of mechanism through which a black hole can gobble up material at a faster pace than previously believed possible. ""LID-568 is remarkable due to its extreme growth rate and the fact that it exists so early in the universe,"" Suh said. ""We don't know yet how LID-568 is able to exceed the Eddington limit. To investigate further, we need more data, so we are planning to conduct follow-up observations with Webb."""

LignoSat, developed by Kyoto University and homebuilder Sumitomo Forestry (1911.T), opens new tab, will be flown to the International Space Station on a SpaceX mission, and later released into orbit about 400 km (250 miles) above the Earth. Named after the Latin word for ""wood"", the palm-sized LignoSat is tasked to demonstrate the cosmic potential of the renewable material as humans explore living in space. ""With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever,"" said Takao Doi, an astronaut who has flown on the Space Shuttle and studies human space activities at Kyoto University. With a 50-year plan of planting trees and building timber houses on the moon and Mars, Doi's team decided to develop a NASA-certified wooden satellite to prove wood is a space-grade material. ""Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood,"" said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. ""A wooden satellite should be feasible, too."" Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because there's no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it, Murata added. A wooden satellite also minimises the environmental impact at the end of its life, the researchers say. Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming space debris. Conventional metal satellites create aluminium oxide particles during re-entry, but wooden ones would just burn up with less pollution, Doi said. ""Metal satellites might be banned in the future,"" Doi said. ""If we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to pitch it to Elon Musk's SpaceX."" The researchers found that honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native to Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is most suited for spacecraft, after a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station. LignoSat is made of honoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts technique without screws or glue. Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in the orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the extreme environment of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight. LignoSat will also gauge wood's ability to reduce the impact of space radiation on semiconductors, making it useful for applications such as data centre construction, said Kenji Kariya, a manager at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute. ""It may seem outdated, but wood is actually cutting-edge technology as civilisation heads to the moon and Mars,"" he said. ""Expansion to space could invigorate the timber industry."""
"243","Science-Technology","Chinese astronauts to conduct experiments in space, including lunar bricks","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323214-chinese-astronauts-to-conduct-experiments-in-space-including-lunar-bricks","China sent three astronauts on Wednesday to its permanently inhabited space station, where they will conduct dozens of scientific experiments, some related to the construction of human habitats. The spacecraft Shenzhou-19 and its three crew lifted off atop a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China at 4:27 a.m. (2027 GMT), according to state media. ""During the Shenzhou-19 flight ... 86 space sci-tech experiments will be carried out in the fields of space life sciences, microgravity physics, materials, medicine, new technologies,"" Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), said in a press conference on Tuesday. One of these experiments is expected to involve exposing bricks made from simulated lunar soil to conditions in space. Should the tests prove successful, the bricks could be a key material used in the construction of a permanent lunar research station, which China hopes to complete by 2035, as it would in theory be more convenient than transporting building materials from Earth. The bricks will be sent in a separate uncrewed cargo spaceflight to the Shenzhou-19 crew next month. The Shenzhou crewed spaceflights have been a regular fixture of China's space program for the past two decades and have increased in frequency in recent years as China built and began operating its ""Tiangong"" space station, officially completed in November 2022. The fast development of China's manned and unmanned space program has alarmed the United States, which has encountered issues with its own crewed spaceflights. Two NASA astronauts brought to the International Space Station by Boeing's Starliner capsule in June have been stranded there since due to unforeseen issues with the spacecraft's propulsion system. They are expected to return in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. CMSA's Lin on Tuesday said that in order to avoid similar issues, the emergency response plan has been ""continuously optimized"" so that astronauts have more time to deal with scenarios such as damage to the Shenzhou-19 caused by space debris. Lin added that Shenzhou-20 and its carrier rocket were on standby and ready to perform an emergency rescue mission if necessary. Since the launch of Shenzhou-14 in June 2022, Shenzhou missions have involved trios of astronauts and six-month stays in space, with an overlap period of several days where the departing crew hands over the station to the newly arrived group. The Shenzhou-19 crew is expected to return to Earth next year in April or May. Lin highlighted that two of the three astronauts crewing the Shenzhou-19 were born in 1990 and conducting their first spaceflight, with Wang Haoze also being the third female Chinese national sent into space. The leader of the crew, 48-year-old Cai Yuzhe, was part of the Shenzhou-14 crew that completed Tiangong's construction. Outside the mission, all three crew members are part of the Chinese military's air force. As Tiangong approaches its second anniversary, China's focus has now turned to the goal of achieving a manned landing on the moon by 2030. In May, China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was launched from the island province of Hainan and successfully returned a month later. While the mission was uncrewed, its completion made China the first country to retrieve samples from the moon's far side. The two younger Shenzhou-19 crew members were part of the third batch of astronauts selected to train for future spaceflights. The fourth batch, announced in 2022, will for the first time be more focused on moon landings, rather than just flights to the Tiangong space station, according to Lin. ""(The training content of the fourth batch) will extend the astronauts' abilities, from controlling spacecraft to driving lunar rovers, from celestial body identification to geological exploration, from weightless floating in space to carrying heavy loads on the moon,"" the CMSA official said."

The latest Shenzhou-19 mission will be led by Cai Xuzhe, who was on the Shenzhou-14 mission in June 2022. The other two crew members, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, are young astronauts born in 1990 that will be conducting their first mission. Wang is currently China's only female spaceflight engineer and will be the third female Chinese national to be sent to space. Before Wang Haoze, female astronauts Liu Yang and Wang Yaping each went on two earlier Shenzhou missions. China launched its first uncrewed spacecraft, Shenzhou-1, in November 1999.

This upgraded console will offer enhanced graphics and the ability to run even the most demanding games at higher and more consistent frame rates. However, this added power comes with a steep price tag -- the PS5 Pro will be Sony's most expensive console to date, priced at £699.99 when it launches on November 7. Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst from research firm Ampere, acknowledged that the high price point is likely to generate considerable discussion. He noted that Sony appears to be banking on the console's superior performance to entice users to upgrade and invest more in software. Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PS5, described the PS5 Pro as ""the most powerful console we've ever built."" He explained that it aims to resolve a long-standing dilemma for gamers: whether to choose ""fidelity mode,"" which prioritizes visuals, or ""performance mode,"" which focuses on smoother gameplay at the expense of graphics. The PS5 Pro is designed to minimize that trade-off. Christopher Dring, head of GamesIndustry.biz, told the BBC that the PS5 Pro is ""a very targeted console"" aimed at PlayStation's ""most enthusiastic audience."" He also mentioned that the console industry has faced challenges this year, with declining sales for the PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and the aging Nintendo Switch. Dring suggested that while the PS5 Pro may not change the overall market situation, Sony could be positioning itself for the release of the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI, which is expected next year. ""When GTA 6 launches, PlayStation will be able to claim that the game looks best on the PS5 Pro,"" he said. The release of the PS5 Pro is part of a relatively new trend of ""pro"" hardware, where companies release upgraded versions of current-generation consoles with improved graphics and performance but without exclusive games. This means that games will still be available for the standard PS5, with players having the option to experience them on the regular or pro model, depending on their preferences. This marks Sony's second significant venture into the ""pro"" console market, following the release of the PS4 Pro in 2016, which introduced 4K graphics to the PlayStation 4. The PS5 Pro arrives three years after Nintendo released its own pro model, a Nintendo Switch with a larger, improved screen. While this announcement from Sony may not be as groundbreaking as the introduction of 4K graphics with the PS4 Pro, it still represents a meaningful advancement in home console technology. It comes at a time when PCs, powered by Nvidia's Geforce 40 series graphics cards, have been leading the way in visual performance. However, consoles like the PS5 Pro continue to strike a balance between high-quality visuals and affordability, especially when a single high-end PC graphics card can cost as much as an entire console. With the launch of the PS5 Pro, Sony will offer multiple versions of the PS5, each catering to different price points and performance needs."

"250","Science-Technology","Why is Bluesky gaining popularity in Pakistan over Elon Musk's X?","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324206-why-is-bluesky-gaining-popularity-in-pakistan-over-elon-musk-s-x","Amid growing discontent with X (formerly Twitter), social media users particularly in Pakistan are flocking to a new alternative: Bluesky. The platform, which has seen a surge in new sign-ups globally is quickly gaining traction in Pakistan, where X has become increasingly inaccessible without the use of a VPN. As of mid-November 2024, Bluesky’s user base has exploded from 13 million in late October to 15 million, with over a million new sign-ups per day. The rapid migration is being fueled by dissatisfaction with X’s recent policies and its management under Elon Musk, compounded by the growing appeal of Bluesky's decentralised, user-centric model. Why is Bluesky gaining popularity in Pakistan? Bluesky’s sudden rise in Pakistan comes in the wake of increasing accessibility issues with X. Due to government restrictions and the growing need for a VPN to access X, many Pakistani users have turned to Bluesky as an alternative. The appeal of Bluesky lies in its promise of a cleaner, more user-friendly experience, offering similar features to X but without the toxicity and complexities of Musk’s platform. In Pakistan, as well as other regions, Bluesky is becoming a popular alternative for those frustrated by X’s changes. This includes the recent controversial policy change that allows blocked users to view public accounts.  Bluesky, on the other hand, offers enhanced moderation tools, which allow users to control their feeds more effectively and avoid unwanted interactions. These features, along with a decentralized architecture that ensures greater privacy and security, have drawn many users seeking refuge from the increasingly chaotic and regulated environment on X. What is Bluesky? Bluesky, originally conceived as a project within Twitter by co-founder Jack Dorsey, was designed to create an open, decentralized standard for social media. Launched in 2021 as an independent entity, Bluesky has quickly evolved into a strong competitor to X, offering a more customizable and transparent user experience. The platform operates on a decentralized model, meaning that instead of relying on centralized servers owned by one company, users can host their data on independent servers that align with their community values. This contrasts sharply with X, where user data is controlled by one entity, raising concerns about privacy and censorship.  Bluesky’s decentralized structure allows users to join or create servers that better reflect their personal values and preferences. This gives users greater control over the content they see and share, which is a significant draw for those frustrated with X’s algorithm-driven feeds. While X pushes content based on algorithms, Bluesky limits visible posts to those from followed accounts, ensuring a more personalized and less overwhelming experience. Growing discontent with X under Musk’s leadership The dissatisfaction with X has escalated under the leadership of Elon Musk. Since Musk's acquisition of Twitter, the platform has undergone numerous changes, some of which have alienated longtime users. From the reinstatement of banned accounts to the easing of block functions that allow blocked users to still view public posts, many feel that X has strayed too far from its original purpose as a platform for open, moderated discussion. The situation has worsened with Musk’s increasingly close association with political figures like US president-elect Donald Trump, which has raised concerns about X's role in amplifying misinformation and extremist content. This has prompted both international organizations and users to seek alternatives, with many finding refuge in Bluesky’s commitment to transparency, privacy, and content moderation. Bluesky’s rapid growth has been further accelerated by recent political developments. When X temporarily halted operations in Brazil in September, Bluesky saw a significant influx of new users, with 2.6 million sign-ups, 85% of whom were Brazilian. In Pakistan, where X remains restricted, Bluesky has become a beacon for those in search of a safer and more controlled social media environment. Many Pakistani users, including journalists and public figures, are shifting to Bluesky, seeking a platform that allows them to share their content without the risk of harassment or exposure to misinformation. Who’s making the switch? Bluesky’s appeal is not limited to ordinary users. Prominent public figures, journalists, celebrities, and even politicians are jumping ship from X to Bluesky. In the UK, MPs such as Jess Phillips, Layla Moran, and Diane Abbott have made the move, and across the globe, celebrities like Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Packham, and Dara Ó Briain have followed suit. These figures are looking for a platform that offers greater control over their interactions and a space free from the increasing toxicity found on X. In Pakistan, this trend is being mirrored. Journalists, activists, and public figures are embracing Bluesky, appreciating its cleaner, ad-free environment that encourages more meaningful interactions. Celebrities, influencers, and even politicians who had previously been vocal on X are now increasingly opting to voice their opinions on Bluesky, which offers them a space that aligns more with their values. What makes Bluesky different? One of the defining features of Bluesky is its commitment to moderation. On Bluesky, users can choose the algorithms that drive their feeds, giving them the ability to curate their online experience. This could mean creating a feed tailored to close friends, specific interests, or more formal professional connections. Bluesky also allows users to customize their profile handles, which is particularly useful for journalists, public figures, and professionals who want to add a layer of verification to their accounts. In contrast, X’s recent modifications to its block function—where blocked users can still view public accounts—have drawn sharp criticism from users who feel that the platform is becoming more permissive toward harmful content. Bluesky, however, offers ""anti-toxicity"" features that allow users to detach their posts from unwanted interactions, protecting them from online harassment. Bluesky’s moderation tools and user-centric features, such as customizability and a focus on user control, make it a strong contender for those looking for a safer, more enjoyable online experience. Its decentralized model, which puts the power back in the hands of the users, has made it a go-to platform for those dissatisfied with the direction X is headed."

CEO Lei Jun said on his social media account that the electronics maker was raising its goal from a previous target to deliver 120,000 of its first EV, the SU7 sedan, as demand surges. This is also far more than an initial goal of 76,000 it set when it launched the SU7 early this year. Xiaomi launched the car, which takes styling cues from Porsche, in March, entering a crowded Chinese EV market with an attention-grabbing price tag - under $30,000 for the base model, $4,000 cheaper than that of Tesla's Model 3 in China. EV and plug-in hybrid sales in China have grown to account for over half of overall sales in the world's largest auto maker. In October they grew by 56.7% from the prior year, marking the fourth consecutive month battery-powered autos including plug-ins outsold gasoline cars in the country. To keep up with demand, Xiaomi has doubled production shifts since June and launched the premium SU7 Ultra model priced at more than $110,000. Xiaomi's President Lu Weibing told a post-earnings call that its factory now had the capacity to make 20,000 cars each month and that he still saw scope for that to grow. ""Our investment is still very substantial and we continue to improve our hardware and software. And basically it doesn't matter what the ultimate delivery level is, we are still investing very heavily. We are working on R&D (research and development) for new models,"" he said. One of the areas Xiaomi was working on was developing autonomous driving technology, he added. Revenue was 92.5 billion yuan ($12.77 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating an LSEG consensus estimate from 15 analysts of 91.1 billion yuan. Huatai Securities has forecast Xiaomi will deliver 400,000 EVs in 2025 when electric cars will grow to account for roughly a fifth of revenue compared with 8% for this year. Xiaomi's auto business though is still operating at a loss. The unit reported an adjusted loss of 1.5 billion yuan for the quarter, with a gross profit margin of 17.1%. During the quarter, Xiaomi maintained its position as the world's third-largest smartphone maker with shipments of 42.8 million units, up 3% and capturing 14% of the market, according to research firm Canalys. Lu said the company planned to increase the number of offline retail stores in mainland China from 13,000 to 15,000 by the end of the year and 20,000 to next year, and was investing heavily in technology to grow its market share. Xiaomi reported adjusted net profit up 4.4% to 6.25 billion yuan, versus a consensus estimate of 5.92 billion yuan."

In an upcoming update, WhatsApp will replace the current dull grey icons with vibrant, colourful themed icons for individual contacts and group chats. At present, the default grey icons for contacts, groups, and communities provide a uniform appearance, especially for users without profile photos. While this creates a clean look, it often complicates quick identification of contacts or groups.The new feature, spotted by WABetaInfo, will address this limitation by introducing unique, colour-coded icons for each contact and group chat, allowing users to easily distinguish between them without opening each conversation.  This update draws inspiration from the Android stock app’s address book, where each contact is represented by a distinct, colour-coded icon.For contacts who have not set a profile picture or have opted to hide it for privacy reasons, WhatsApp will assign a default, vibrant themed icon. These icons will be characterised by a specific colour scheme, enabling users to easily identify contacts, even if their names are similar or they lack photos. Similarly, group chats and communities will also benefit from this update. If a group lacks a profile image or shares the same name with others, the distinct themed icons will help users quickly recognise which group they are interacting with, eliminating the need to sift through multiple chats. Currently under development, this new feature is expected to roll out in a future update. However, WhatsApp beta testers using the latest Android beta version (2.24.24.12) can already access the feature, which is available for download from the Google Play Store. WhatsApp users will have to wait a little longer to enjoy this feature, but once it is officially launched, it is likely to bring a much-needed visual refresh to the app, enhancing usability and streamlining chat navigation."

The human rights organisation warned that the growing reliance on mass surveillance in the country's social benefits system is undermining the very purpose of these programs, which are meant to support vulnerable individuals. Hellen Mukiri-Smith, an AI researcher and co-author of the report, explained that the algorithms used by the Danish welfare agency Udbetalning Danmark are creating a system that targets rather than supports citizens. ""Mass surveillance has created a social benefits system that risks targeting, rather than supporting, the very people it was meant to protect,"" she said. Amnesty International analyzed four algorithms, out of 60 used by Udbetalning Danmark, which rely on personal data from public databases. The algorithms are designed to detect fraud related to a variety of welfare benefits, including pensions, parental leave, sick leave, and student grants. The data used includes sensitive information such as residence, travel history, citizenship, income, family relationships, and place of birth. One particular algorithm, dubbed the ""Model Abroad,"" scrutinizes recipients' nationality to determine if they are fraudulently collecting benefits while living abroad. The report points out that this model disproportionately impacts individuals based on their citizenship, which Amnesty argues violates their right to non-discrimination. David Nolan, another author of the report, noted that 90 percent of cases flagged by the ""Model Abroad"" algorithm ultimately turn out not to be fraudulent, emphasizing its potential to cause harm. ""We argue this does directly violate their right to non-discrimination because of the use of citizenship,"" Nolan told AFP. Amnesty International has called on the Danish government to take immediate action to address these concerns. Specifically, the organization urges authorities to increase transparency around the use of these algorithms, allow for audits of the systems, and stop using sensitive data related to nationality or citizenship. ""Feeding personal data into an algorithmic model needs to be done with much greater care,"" Nolan added. The report also highlights a potential side effect of the reliance on digital systems in welfare services—exclusion of marginalized groups. Amnesty warns that vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and certain foreign nationals, may be disproportionately impacted by digital barriers, which could prevent them from accessing benefits they are entitled to. The report is the latest in a series of critiques of algorithmic use in social services in Western countries. In October, 15 organizations, including Amnesty, filed a legal complaint against the French welfare agency CNAF for using similar algorithms to detect undue payments."

Durov is now offering free IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) treatments for women who choose to use his sperm, with the full cost of the procedure covered by him. Teaming up with Altravita, a renowned fertility clinic, Durov’s initiative aims to help women facing difficulties conceiving. Altravita, which holds exclusive rights to store and use his sperm, is providing the IVF treatments with a focus on high-quality care and cutting-edge technology to ensure the best possible success rates. “This is an opportunity to help people who are looking to start a family and are facing challenges with traditional methods of conception,” Durov explained. The clinic promises that women who qualify for the program will receive expert care and personalized support throughout the process. To be eligible, women must be under the age of 37 and in good health. After an initial consultation, they will be guided through the IVF journey with the assistance of Altravita’s experienced medical team. This offer is rooted in Durov’s longstanding commitment to sperm donation. In a recent post on his Telegram channel, Durov shared a personal anecdote about his previous donations. “I was just told that I have over 100 biological children. How is this possible for a guy who has never been married and prefers to live alone?” he mused, highlighting his unconventional path to becoming a donor. His journey began 15 years ago when a close friend, unable to conceive with his wife, asked Durov for sperm. Initially skeptical, Durov agreed, and this small act led to a much larger impact, benefiting families across the globe. Over the years, Durov has become a prolific donor, helping more than 100 families in 12 countries. The shortage of healthy sperm, especially for couples seeking donors, has become a growing concern worldwide. Durov’s decision to make his sperm available is seen as a response to this crisis, with his donations contributing to alleviating the shortage of high-quality donor material. “I’m proud that I did my part to help solve this issue,” Durov said. “It’s something that should be normalized, and I hope my efforts will encourage others to consider donating.” Durov’s initiative is not just about helping families—it is also part of his larger mission to destigmatize sperm donation. He believes that the act of donation should be celebrated as a valuable resource for those struggling with infertility, rather than something to be shamed. “Defy convention—redefine the norm!” he said, urging other healthy men to follow his lead and consider sperm donation. While some might view Durov’s gesture as unconventional or even eccentric, there is no denying the significant impact it could have on the lives of those unable to conceive. For many, his offer provides not just a chance for a child but also an opportunity to challenge societal norms surrounding reproduction."

Senior executives from firms such as Apple, Microsoft, and Meta will join high-ranking officials from Europe for debates about the future of artificial intelligence, social media regulation, and the impact a second Trump presidency may have on the continent. Trump has previously promised he could end the war between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours of taking office. Days after Trump's re-election, two senior Ukrainian government officials, Alex Bornyakov and Mykhailo Fedorov, will take to the stage to discuss how the country has continued innovating in the face of conflict. John Adam, chief revenue officer at software development firm Aimsoftpro, is among those attending. About 70% of the company’s workforce is still based in Ukraine, with the rest having relocated around Europe after the war’s outbreak in 2022. “There’s mixed feelings because the Trump approach looks like it’s more geared towards the present lines of conflict, which is not an ideal scenario for Ukraine, and there’s a reluctance to accept that. At the same time, we would like this to have an endpoint,” he said. While not expected to attend, tech billionaire and vocal Trump supporter Elon Musk will be a recurring theme, from his role in Ukraine via satellite service Starlink to his success with space exploration firm SpaceX and controversial stewardship of social media platform X, formerly Twitter. One panel will debate how Europe might develop a homegrown rival to SpaceX; another whether Musk “destroyed Twitter"". Joe Benarroch, who quit his role as X’s de facto spokesperson and head of business operations in June, will join a panel titled “What to do about social media”. While the EU has tried forcing online platforms to clamp down on harmful content, Trump’s election may lead to them reducing moderation efforts, according to Mark Weinstein, founder of privacy-focused social media platform MeWe, who will share the stage with Benarroch on Wednesday. “Historically, Trump has been highly critical of online moderation,” he said. “To avoid political retribution, major social networks are likely to continue the trend of becoming significantly more permissive with content they allow on their platforms.”"

The latest public beta versions of these operating systems bring to the forefront some of the most exciting AI-driven features, including ChatGPT integration with Siri, innovative image tools, and a new generative AI experience dubbed  Apple Intelligence.This release marks an important leap in Apple's push towards integrating generative AI into its ecosystem, making it a standout feature across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The public beta of iOS 18.2 follows Apple's previous release, iOS 18.1, which introduced an array of AI tools, such as writing suggestions for documents and emails, and photo tools like   Clean Up for removing unwanted elements from images. But it's with the latest beta that   Apple Intelligence truly steps into the spotlight, offering an integrated suite of features that will reshape how users interact with their Apple devices. Apple's new generative AI, aptly named   Apple Intelligence  , promises to offer a more personalized, privacy-conscious alternative to the AI models currently dominating the tech landscape. Apple describes its AI initiative as   “AI for the rest of us,”   aiming to simplify complex tasks through contextual understanding and predictive capabilities. Unlike the industry-standard generative AI tools, Apple Intelligence focuses on deeply integrating AI with Apple's hardware and software, enhancing user experience while maintaining its commitment to privacy. The AI features include   GenMoji  , a tool that creates unique avatars based on your photos,   Image Playground, which allows users to generate images from prompts, and integrations with   ChatGPT that bring sophisticated text generation and writing assistance directly to Apple’s ecosystem. All of these tools are designed to operate on Apple devices with seamless interaction, keeping the user experience intuitive and secure. The Power of Siri Reimagined One of the most significant updates brought by   Apple Intelligence   is to Siri. The voice assistant has undergone a major redesign, enhancing its natural language processing abilities and making it more intuitive than ever. Siri can now handle more complex tasks and understand context across multiple apps. This means that, instead of just responding to commands, Siri can help users manage schedules, navigate traffic, and even assist with personalized recommendations based on their preferences and habits. Additionally, Siri will now feature a new design, including a glowing border when active and a double-tap gesture to type commands. This level of interaction is a breakthrough in making Siri feel like a more natural, conversational tool. Perhaps most notably,   Apple Intelligence allows users to interact with Siri through typing, marking a major shift in how the virtual assistant functions. This new voice and text integration positions Siri as not just a voice tool but a comprehensive assistant capable of handling more advanced tasks with a greater level of understanding. Siri meets ChatGPT One of the most intriguing features of   Apple Intelligence   is its integration with   ChatGPT  , bringing powerful generative AI capabilities to Siri. The iOS 18.2 beta will allow users to request responses from ChatGPT directly through Siri, merging the convenience of Apple’s voice assistant with the deep conversational abilities of OpenAI’s AI model. Users will no longer need to juggle between apps to access ChatGPT’s writing suggestions, conversational prompts, or summaries. Siri will handle it all seamlessly, responding with a more human-like tone and providing solutions that are tailored to each user's unique preferences. What makes Apple Intelligence unique? What sets   Apple Intelligence   apart from its competitors is its emphasis on user privacy. Unlike other generative AI tools, which process data on third-party servers, Apple’s AI is designed to work on-device as much as possible. This approach ensures that personal data is kept secure, and the AI adapts to individual user preferences without compromising privacy. Apple’s emphasis on privacy is one of the most significant differentiators in the crowded AI market. By processing data locally on devices and only occasionally sending information to the cloud (via   Private Cloud Compute  ), Apple ensures that user data is not only secure but also personalized to a higher degree. Lisa Eadicicco, a writer for   CNET  , explains that   Apple Intelligence   is built to consider multiple personal context factors when generating responses. For example, Apple’s AI can factor in your calendar, contacts, and even real-time traffic conditions to help you manage your day more efficiently. This personalized approach gives users an experience unlike any other AI on the market. At the moment,   Apple Intelligence   is available for testing through the public beta on select devices. The compatibility list includes the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, as well as iPads and Macs with an M1 chip or later. This list features some of Apple's most powerful hardware, such as the iPhone 16 Pro, iPad Mini with the A17 Pro chip, and MacBook Pro models powered by M1, M2, or M3 chips. Apple’s strategy of rolling out   Apple Intelligence   to only a select set of devices initially has raised concerns about its accessibility. However, with support for the iPhone 15 Pro series and the latest iPads and Macs, the core Apple user base is still well-positioned to enjoy the benefits of this next-generation AI. What’s next for Apple Intelligence? Looking ahead, Apple plans to roll out additional features and capabilities for   Apple Intelligence  , with broader language support expected in 2025. Initially,   Apple Intelligence   will be available in the United States, with localized English versions expected for the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa by December 2024. As Apple continues to refine its AI technology, the potential for new features—ranging from more personalized Siri interactions to even more powerful writing and image tools—remains high. Is Apple Intelligence free? Apple has stated that   Apple Intelligence   will be available for free with no announced plans for charging users for its services. This makes   Apple Intelligence   not only an exciting feature for those looking to enhance their productivity and creative potential but also a compelling option for Apple device owners seeking more intelligent, privacy-focused AI tools."

Indonesia requires certain smartphones sold domestically to contain at least 40% of parts manufactured locally and the iPhone 16 has not met the requirement, ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief said in a statement issued on Friday. ""Imported iPhone 16 hardwares cannot be marketed in the country, because Apple Indonesia has not fulfilled its investment commitment to earn a local content certification,"" he said, adding that the phones can still be brought from abroad for personal use as long as users pay the necessary taxes. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's iPhone 16 phones were first released in September. The top two smartphone makers in the first quarter of 2024 in Indonesia were Chinese firm OPPO and South Korean firm Samsung, research firm IDC said in May. Indonesia has a huge, tech-savvy population, making the Southeast Asian nation a key target market for tech-related investment. During a visit by Apple's CEO Tim Cook to Indonesia last April, Indonesia's Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said he hoped the tech giant would increase its local content by partnering with domestic firms. Companies usually increase the domestic requirement through such local partnerships or by sourcing parts domestically. Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, but since 2018 it has been setting up app developer academies, which including the new academy have a total cost of 1.6 trillion rupiah ($101.8 million)."

A comprehensive specifications sheet has now surfaced, detailing everything from RAM capacity to Wi-Fi connectivity. This leak comes from well-known source @Jukanlosreve, so it's more than likely to be accurate - yet nothing is confirmed until the phone is officially released. Some of these specifications have already leaked, while others are fresh. According to the specs sheet, the iPhone SE 4 will be powered by the A18 chipset (the same CPU seen in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus). This is supposedly going to be coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Having the same chipset and RAM as the flagship iPhones is crucial for one reason: it means the iPhone SE 4 will be able to run all the AI tricks and capabilities that will be available as part of Apple Intelligence beginning next week. We may expect a 6.06-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2532 x 1170 pixels. That is a significant improvement over the 4.7-inch LCD in the third-generation iPhone SE (2022), and (as previously anticipated) is comparable to the iPhone 14. It means that the iPhone SE 4 will be the first in the series to forego the home button and Touch ID in favor of the more modern design of the most recent flagship iPhones. The phone appears to weigh 165 grams, which is little heavier than its predecessor's weight of 144 grams. Other features include a single 48MP rear camera, a 12MP selfie camera, Wi-Fi 6, IP68 water and dust protection, and a 3,279mAh battery (up from 2,018mAh on the current model). According to this source, the iPhone SE 4 will start at $499, therefore we can expect a price increase from the previous price point of $429 / £419 / AU$719.

Gurman suggests that after this release, the tech world's focus will shift to Apple's annual developers conference, WWDC, set for June. Here, we present speculations and anticipations surrounding these upcoming devices. The iPad Air is predicted to come in two variants, boasting 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch displays.  The new iPad Air is expected to have new features, including a faster chip called the M2 from Apple, a new camera on the back, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. No substantial modifications to the external design are anticipated. The forthcoming 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models are widely speculated to introduce the integration of OLED displays into the iPad series. OLED technology assures an elevation in brightness, enhanced contrast ratio, reduced power consumption, and other advantages compared to current models sporting LCD panels.  Apple has previously embraced OLED displays in its latest iPhone and Apple Watch variants, excluding the more budget-friendly iPhone SE. Due to this shift to OLED, the next iPad Pro releases are expected to carry a higher price tag. iPad Pro models introduced in 2017 and onwards support ProMotion, easing a variable refresh rate ranging from 24Hz to 120Hz. The transition to OLED could possibly push the refresh rate even lower, perhaps to 10Hz or below, maintaining battery life. Moreover, the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro models can reach an impressively low 1Hz in an always-on display mode. Additional anticipated or highly likely features for the iPad Pro models include the use of Apple's latest M3 chip for enhanced performance, the inclusion of MagSafe wireless charging, and a revamped Magic Keyboard. The Magic Keyboard features an expanded trackpad and an aluminium top casing. Similar to the iPad Air, alterations to the rear camera bump are also within the realm of possibility for the iPad Pro. The current iPad Pro models, equipped with the M2 chip, made their debut in October 2022. Gurman's insights hint at Apple's purpose to unveil multiple MacBook Airs equipped with the M3 chip this spring, suggesting a simultaneous release of the next 13-inch and 15-inch models, a difference from past separate launches. With the introduction of the M3 chip, the coming MacBook Air models are set to incorporate hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, upgrading graphics rendering in games with improved accuracy in lighting, reflections, and shadows. Apple had previously integrated the M3 chip into the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac in the preceding year. No major aesthetic alterations are expected for the MacBook Air in the upcoming release, but it is anticipated to join other Macs in supporting Wi-Fi 6E. The 13-inch MacBook Air received its last update in July 2022, while the inaugural 15-inch MacBook Air was unveiled in June 2023."

Senior executives from firms such as Apple, Microsoft, and Meta will join high-ranking officials from Europe for debates about the future of artificial intelligence, social media regulation, and the impact a second Trump presidency may have on the continent. Trump has previously promised he could end the war between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours of taking office. Days after Trump's re-election, two senior Ukrainian government officials, Alex Bornyakov and Mykhailo Fedorov, will take to the stage to discuss how the country has continued innovating in the face of conflict. John Adam, chief revenue officer at software development firm Aimsoftpro, is among those attending. About 70% of the company’s workforce is still based in Ukraine, with the rest having relocated around Europe after the war’s outbreak in 2022. “There’s mixed feelings because the Trump approach looks like it’s more geared towards the present lines of conflict, which is not an ideal scenario for Ukraine, and there’s a reluctance to accept that. At the same time, we would like this to have an endpoint,” he said. While not expected to attend, tech billionaire and vocal Trump supporter Elon Musk will be a recurring theme, from his role in Ukraine via satellite service Starlink to his success with space exploration firm SpaceX and controversial stewardship of social media platform X, formerly Twitter. One panel will debate how Europe might develop a homegrown rival to SpaceX; another whether Musk “destroyed Twitter"". Joe Benarroch, who quit his role as X’s de facto spokesperson and head of business operations in June, will join a panel titled “What to do about social media”. While the EU has tried forcing online platforms to clamp down on harmful content, Trump’s election may lead to them reducing moderation efforts, according to Mark Weinstein, founder of privacy-focused social media platform MeWe, who will share the stage with Benarroch on Wednesday. “Historically, Trump has been highly critical of online moderation,” he said. “To avoid political retribution, major social networks are likely to continue the trend of becoming significantly more permissive with content they allow on their platforms.”"

The unpiloted Progress 89 spacecraft docked at the Russian Zvezda Service module’s port at precisely 5:53 GMT, NASA confirmed. The spacecraft was launched on Wednesday, August 14, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, riding atop a Soyuz rocket. The delivery, which amounts to nearly three tons of supplies, is crucial for the Expedition 71 crew currently aboard the ISS. Among the recipients are NASA astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who have been unable to return to Earth due to unresolved issues with the Starliner spacecraft. The astronauts originally arrived at the ISS in June for what was supposed to be a brief eight-day test mission. However, complications with Starliner’s propulsion system have led to the indefinite extension of their stay. NASA officials have indicated that if the Starliner capsule remains unsafe, Wilmore and Williams may return on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, potentially delaying their return until February 2025. The Roscosmos spacecraft will stay docked at the ISS for approximately six months, serving as a temporary storage facility for waste before it departs and re-enters Earth's atmosphere, where it will burn up during re-entry. This development underscores the challenges faced by international space agencies in ensuring the safety and reliability of crewed space missions. The ongoing issues with the Starliner capsule have raised significant concerns within NASA and have placed additional pressure on Boeing to address the technical problems that have plagued the spacecraft."
"293","Science-Technology","Fascinating tunnel discovered on moon","https://www.samaa.tv/2087318083-fascinating-tunnel-discovered-on-moon","Planetary scientists have confirmed the presence of a tunnel system on the moon, igniting excitement about the potential for more hidden structures beneath its surface. This revelation comes from a reanalysis of data collected by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which first captured images of a mysterious pit in the moon's Mare Tranquillitatis, or ""Sea of Tranquility,"" in 2010. The newly analyzed observations, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, reveal that the pit is not merely a surface anomaly but part of a larger lunar cave system. ""We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg,"" said Wes Patterson, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and coauthor of the study. This statement underscores the vast potential for discovering more subterranean structures on the moon. The researchers utilized data from the LRO's Miniature Radio-Frequency (Mini-RF) radar instrument to probe the pit's interior. The radar signals, bouncing back from the depths of the pit, provided critical evidence of a tunnel extending approximately 40 meters in width and potentially reaching up to 80 meters in length. This tunnel is believed to be a lava tube, a type of volcanic formation created by the flow of molten rock beneath the moon’s surface. Lava tubes on Earth are well-documented and can be explored on foot, offering a natural pathway through hardened lava. The discovery of such a structure on the moon suggests that similar features could be widespread, hinting at a network of subterranean passages formed by ancient volcanic activity.

In Palworld, where lots of different Pals roam around, you may find yourself caught up in capturing them to build your Pal squad and level up. But truth be told, not every Pal is a superstar. Maybe you caught some Pals with not-so-great traits – they're weak, clumsy, or just wreck things. These not-so-helpful Pals might make you want to get rid of them. Instead of causing them harm and leaving a mess at your base, why not make some money by selling them? Learn all the details about selling Pals in Palworld. In Palworld, you can trade your Pals with a Pal Trader. There's one hanging out in the Small Settlement area, kinda in the middle of the island. When you're in the Small Settlement, look for a shed with a Pal Sphere outside – that's where you'll find the Pal Trader NPC.  To swap your Pal, just talk to the Pal Trader, choose the swap option, and pick the Pal you want to trade. You'll get money in return for your Pal.

While the game primarily involves solo progression, collaborating with friends adds an extra layer of enjoyment. In this article, we explore the intricacies of playing Palworld in multiplayer mode, from setting up sessions to encountering unique challenges. In Palworld, players can choose between hosting or joining personal save files, accommodating up to four players, or diving into dedicated servers supporting up to 32 players. Joining a personal save file is straightforward; players input the invite code provided by the host in their options. Alternatively, dedicated servers, currently exclusive to Steam, offer a broader multiplayer experience. To initiate a personal save file session, the host generates an invite code, which players use to join. It's essential to toggle the multiplayer option in the world settings, ensuring a smooth experience. Dedicated servers, accessible only on Steam, provide additional flexibility, allowing players to join public servers, host their own, or opt for a hosting website. Read more: Palworld hits 6 million sales after weekend surge of 86,000 copies per hour Palworld's multiplayer mode introduces notable distinctions. Players can collaborate to take down tower bosses, like Zoe and Grizzbolt, fostering a sense of camaraderie. Guilds function as parties, restricting base collaboration to guild members. However, world exploration remains an individual endeavor, requiring players to uncover maps and unlock fast travel points independently. Loot in Palworld multiplayer is tied to the world, not individual players. Items picked up, such as chests or Pal Spheres, cannot be shared among players. This dynamic adds strategic depth and challenges, encouraging players to coordinate their efforts while understanding the limitations of shared loot. While dedicated servers offer an expansive multiplayer experience, some peculiar issues may arise. These issues include difficulties jumping up cliffs and discrepancies in item counting during construction. It's important to note that these challenges may be attributed to the early access nature of Palworld, introducing occasional hiccups. Palworld currently lacks crossplay compatibility between Xbox and Steam versions. Players must ensure everyone in their group owns the game on the same platform to enjoy multiplayer sessions together. Pocketpair, the developers, express their commitment to enabling crossplay in the future, promising an enhanced gaming experience for all players."

Zomato entered into ""exclusivity contracts"" with partners in return for lower commissions, while Swiggy guaranteed business growth to certain players if they listed exclusively on its platform, according to non-public documents prepared by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Exclusivity arrangements between Swiggy, Zomato and their respective restaurant partners ""prevent the market from becoming more competitive,"" the CCI's investigation arm noted in its findings reviewed by Reuters on Friday. The antitrust investigation against Swiggy and its top rival Zomato began in 2022 after a complaint by National Restaurant Association of India about the impact on food outlets of alleged anti-competitive practices of the platforms. The CCI documents are not public, in line with its confidentiality rules, and were shared with Swiggy, Zomato and the complainant restaurant group in March 2024. Their findings have not been previously reported. Zomato declined to comment, while Swiggy and the CCI did not respond to Reuters queries. Shares in Zomato fell 3% after the Reuters report, from being flat in earlier trade. The CCI case is mentioned as one of the ""internal risks"" in Swiggy's IPO prospectus, which says ""any breach of the provisions of Competition Act, may attract substantial monetary penalties."" The CCI report noted that Swiggy told investigators the ""Swiggy Exclusive"" program was phased out in 2023, but the company ""is planning to launch similar program (Swiggy Grow) in non-metropolitan cities."" Food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato have in recent years reshaped how Indians order food, as hundreds of thousands of outlets listed on their apps just when smartphone use, and online ordering, both grew rapidly. Swiggy, which on Friday is closing bids for its $1.4 billion IPO - India's second biggest this year, and Zomato both in recent years also pushed restaurants to maintain a parity on prices, directly reducing competition in the market by preventing restaurants offering lower prices on other online platforms, the CCI documents stated. Zomato was found to have imposed pricing and discount restrictions on restaurant partners, and in some cases included a ""penal provision"" if the outlet failed to comply. Some of Swiggy's partner restaurants were ""threatened that their rankings will be pushed down, if they do not maintain price parity,"" the CCI's investigation arm noted. The next, and final phase, of the CCI case is a decision by the CCI leadership which is still reviewing the investigation findings to decide on any penalty or order changes to Swiggy's and Zomato's business practices. That decision could take several weeks, and the companies still have the option of contesting the investigation findings with the CCI. Zomato, which listed in 2021, has seen its shares more than triple to a valuation of about $27 billion amid rising demand. Swiggy is valuing itself at $11.3 billion in its IPO. Macquarie Capital estimates Swiggy's food order values in 2024-25 will be $3.3 billion, roughly 25% below Zomato's. Both are now diversifying fast into quick commerce where groceries are delivered in as little as 10 minutes. India's biggest group of retail distributors has asked the antitrust authority to investigate quick commerce businesses of Zomato, Swiggy and another rival Zepto for alleged predatory pricing, Reuters reported last month."

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that the proposed law, which will be introduced in parliament next week, is aimed at reducing the ""harm"" social media poses to Australian children. ""This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,"" Albanese said. The details are still under discussion, but the government clarified that the ban will not apply to children already active on social media, and there will be no parental consent exemptions. Social media platforms will be responsible for proving they are taking reasonable steps to prevent underage access. Enforcement of the law will fall under Australia’s online regulator, the eSafety Commissioner, with no penalties for users. If passed, the legislation will take effect 12 months later and undergo a review afterward. Many experts agree that social media can harm adolescents’ mental health, though opinions vary on whether a ban is the best approach. Some believe bans only delay exposure to platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook rather than preparing young people to navigate online spaces safely. Similar restrictions have proven difficult in other regions, such as the European Union, where age-verification measures have faced challenges. Australia's Child Rights Taskforce, a major advocacy group, criticized the proposed law as ""too blunt"" and urged the government to consider ""safety standards"" instead. In an open letter, the group cited UN guidance recommending policies that enable children to safely engage with digital environments rather than restricting access. However, some campaigners support the ban, citing concerns about children’s exposure to harmful content, misinformation, and online bullying. The 36Months initiative, which has gathered over 125,000 signatures, argues children ""not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely"" until at least 16, and that currently ""excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness"". Asked if the focus should instead be on teaching children to manage the benefits and risks of the online world, Albanese argued that education alone is inadequate, as it ""assumes an equal power relationship."" ""I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,"" he said on Thursday. ""These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour."""

In fact, these objects, which increase in mass over time by eating material that wanders too close, reside at the center of most galaxies. But since NASA's James Webb Space Telescope came online in 2022, astronomers have been surprised to find supermassive black holes inhabiting the early universe - earlier than they had thought possible considering the time needed to gather such great mass. New observations of one such primordial black hole is offering insight into how this may have occurred - through episodes of supercharged growth. Black holes are extremely dense objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape. With their immense gravitational pull, they grow in mass by sucking in material such as gas, dust and stars unfortunate enough to stray nearby. ""The existence of supermassive black holes in the early universe challenges our current models of black hole formation and growth,"" said astronomer Hyewon Suh of the International Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and the U.S. National Science Foundation's NOIRLab, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy. The new Webb observations involve a supermassive black hole called LID-568 that existed when the cosmos was about 11% its current age - about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang event 13.8 billion years ago that initiated the universe. LID-568 has a mass about 10 million times greater than the sun, so 2-1/2 times that of Sagittarius A*. The researchers have not yet determined the mass of its home galaxy. LID-568 was observed gaining mass at a pace faster than previously thought possible. Webb showed that, based on its observed energetic output, LID-568 appeared to be consuming infalling material - known as accretion - at more than 40 times the hypothesized maximum, called the Eddington limit, for such activity. ""The Eddington limit is a theoretical limit for the maximum energy output the black hole can produce through the accretion process. This theoretical limit assumes that the outward force from the radiation produced during the accretion process balances the gravity of the infalling material,"" said astronomer and study co-author Julia Scharwächter of the Gemini Observatory and NOIRLab. These primordial black holes are thought to have originated in one of two ways, either following the explosive death of the universe's first generation of stars or through the collapse of large clouds of gas present in the early universe. ""The discovery of LID-568 suggests that a significant portion of mass growth can occur during a single episode of rapid accretion. This could help explain how supermassive black holes formed so early in the universe, regardless of how they originated,"" Suh said. ""Until now, we have lacked observational confirmation of how these black holes could grow so quickly in the early universe,"" Suh added. A key sign of a growing supermassive black hole is emission of X-rays, high-energy electromagnetic radiation with very short wavelengths. Material swirling around a supermassive black hole before it is consumed is superheated and glows strongly in X-ray wavelengths. The researchers first spotted LID-568 using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and then studied it more closely using Webb's infrared observational capabilities. The Webb observations suggest the existence of some sort of mechanism through which a black hole can gobble up material at a faster pace than previously believed possible. ""LID-568 is remarkable due to its extreme growth rate and the fact that it exists so early in the universe,"" Suh said. ""We don't know yet how LID-568 is able to exceed the Eddington limit. To investigate further, we need more data, so we are planning to conduct follow-up observations with Webb."""

Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because there's no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it, Murata added. A wooden satellite also minimises the environmental impact at the end of its life, the researchers say. Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming space debris. Conventional metal satellites create aluminium oxide particles during re-entry, but wooden ones would just burn up with less pollution, Doi said. ""Metal satellites might be banned in the future,"" Doi said. ""If we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to pitch it to Elon Musk's SpaceX."" The researchers found that honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native to Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is most suited for spacecraft, after a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station. LignoSat is made of honoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts technique without screws or glue. Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in the orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the extreme environment of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight. LignoSat will also gauge wood's ability to reduce the impact of space radiation on semiconductors, making it useful for applications such as data centre construction, said Kenji Kariya, a manager at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute. ""It may seem outdated, but wood is actually cutting-edge technology as civilisation heads to the moon and Mars,"" he said. ""Expansion to space could invigorate the timber industry."""

The spacecraft Shenzhou-19 and its three crew lifted off atop a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China at 4:27 a.m. (2027 GMT), according to state media. ""During the Shenzhou-19 flight ... 86 space sci-tech experiments will be carried out in the fields of space life sciences, microgravity physics, materials, medicine, new technologies,"" Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), said in a press conference on Tuesday. One of these experiments is expected to involve exposing bricks made from simulated lunar soil to conditions in space. Should the tests prove successful, the bricks could be a key material used in the construction of a permanent lunar research station, which China hopes to complete by 2035, as it would in theory be more convenient than transporting building materials from Earth. The bricks will be sent in a separate uncrewed cargo spaceflight to the Shenzhou-19 crew next month. The Shenzhou crewed spaceflights have been a regular fixture of China's space program for the past two decades and have increased in frequency in recent years as China built and began operating its ""Tiangong"" space station, officially completed in November 2022. The fast development of China's manned and unmanned space program has alarmed the United States, which has encountered issues with its own crewed spaceflights. Two NASA astronauts brought to the International Space Station by Boeing's Starliner capsule in June have been stranded there since due to unforeseen issues with the spacecraft's propulsion system. They are expected to return in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. CMSA's Lin on Tuesday said that in order to avoid similar issues, the emergency response plan has been ""continuously optimized"" so that astronauts have more time to deal with scenarios such as damage to the Shenzhou-19 caused by space debris. Lin added that Shenzhou-20 and its carrier rocket were on standby and ready to perform an emergency rescue mission if necessary. Since the launch of Shenzhou-14 in June 2022, Shenzhou missions have involved trios of astronauts and six-month stays in space, with an overlap period of several days where the departing crew hands over the station to the newly arrived group. The Shenzhou-19 crew is expected to return to Earth next year in April or May. Lin highlighted that two of the three astronauts crewing the Shenzhou-19 were born in 1990 and conducting their first spaceflight, with Wang Haoze also being the third female Chinese national sent into space. The leader of the crew, 48-year-old Cai Yuzhe, was part of the Shenzhou-14 crew that completed Tiangong's construction. Outside the mission, all three crew members are part of the Chinese military's air force. As Tiangong approaches its second anniversary, China's focus has now turned to the goal of achieving a manned landing on the moon by 2030. In May, China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was launched from the island province of Hainan and successfully returned a month later. While the mission was uncrewed, its completion made China the first country to retrieve samples from the moon's far side. The two younger Shenzhou-19 crew members were part of the third batch of astronauts selected to train for future spaceflights. The fourth batch, announced in 2022, will for the first time be more focused on moon landings, rather than just flights to the Tiangong space station, according to Lin. ""(The training content of the fourth batch) will extend the astronauts' abilities, from controlling spacecraft to driving lunar rovers, from celestial body identification to geological exploration, from weightless floating in space to carrying heavy loads on the moon,"" the CMSA official said."

Indonesia requires certain smartphones sold domestically to contain at least 40% of parts manufactured locally and the iPhone 16 has not met the requirement, ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief said in a statement issued on Friday. ""Imported iPhone 16 hardwares cannot be marketed in the country, because Apple Indonesia has not fulfilled its investment commitment to earn a local content certification,"" he said, adding that the phones can still be brought from abroad for personal use as long as users pay the necessary taxes. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's iPhone 16 phones were first released in September. The top two smartphone makers in the first quarter of 2024 in Indonesia were Chinese firm OPPO and South Korean firm Samsung, research firm IDC said in May. Indonesia has a huge, tech-savvy population, making the Southeast Asian nation a key target market for tech-related investment. During a visit by Apple's CEO Tim Cook to Indonesia last April, Indonesia's Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said he hoped the tech giant would increase its local content by partnering with domestic firms. Companies usually increase the domestic requirement through such local partnerships or by sourcing parts domestically.

A comprehensive specifications sheet has now surfaced, detailing everything from RAM capacity to Wi-Fi connectivity. This leak comes from well-known source @Jukanlosreve, so it's more than likely to be accurate - yet nothing is confirmed until the phone is officially released. Some of these specifications have already leaked, while others are fresh. According to the specs sheet, the iPhone SE 4 will be powered by the A18 chipset (the same CPU seen in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus). This is supposedly going to be coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Having the same chipset and RAM as the flagship iPhones is crucial for one reason: it means the iPhone SE 4 will be able to run all the AI tricks and capabilities that will be available as part of Apple Intelligence beginning next week. We may expect a 6.06-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2532 x 1170 pixels. That is a significant improvement over the 4.7-inch LCD in the third-generation iPhone SE (2022), and (as previously anticipated) is comparable to the iPhone 14. It means that the iPhone SE 4 will be the first in the series to forego the home button and Touch ID in favor of the more modern design of the most recent flagship iPhones. The phone appears to weigh 165 grams, which is little heavier than its predecessor's weight of 144 grams.

According to media reports, numerous users have experienced intermittent glitches, where the touchscreen either becomes unresponsive or reacts with a noticeable delay. Experts believe the problem is not hardware-related but rather a 'software bug.' It is suspected that a hypersensitivity feature in Apple's iOS system, specifically the 'touch rejection algorithm,' is mistakenly detecting intended touches as unwanted, causing the screen to ignore essential inputs. A Reddit post by an iPhone 16 Pro user highlights the frustration faced by many. According to the post, if a user touches near the camera control button, the entire display (except the home bar) becomes unresponsive until the touch is released, further confusing users.  Interestingly, the issue does not occur when the phone is locked, only manifesting when the device is unlocked and in use. This strongly indicates that the problem stems from software, not hardware, and could potentially be resolved in a future iOS update. Apple has yet to release an official statement on the matter, but many users hope that a software fix is in the works to address these concerns."

The National Security and Defence Council announced the restrictions after Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency, presented the council with evidence of Russian special services' ability to snoop on the platform, it said in a statement. But Andriy Kovalenko, head of the security council's centre on countering disinformation, posted on Telegram that the restrictions apply only to official devices, not personal phones. Telegram is heavily used in both Ukraine and Russia and has become a critical source of information since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But Ukrainian security officials have repeatedly voiced concerns about its use during the war. Based in Dubai, Telegram was founded by Russian-born Pavel Durov, who left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with demands to shut down opposition communities on his social media platform VKontakte, which he has sold. Durov was arrested upon landing in France in August as part of an investigation into crimes related to child pornography, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions on Telegram. The Security Council statement said Budanov had provided evidence that Russian special services could access Telegram messages, including deleted ones, as well as users' personal data. ""I have always supported and continue to support freedom of speech, but the issue of Telegram is not a matter of freedom of speech, it is a matter of national security,"" Budanov said in his own statement. After the decision was announced, Telegram issued a statement saying it had never disclosed anyone's data or the contents of any message. ""Telegram has never provided any messaging data to any country, including Russia. Deleted messages are deleted forever and are technically impossible to recover,"" Telegram said. It said every instance of what it described as ""leaked messages"" had been proven to be ""the result of a compromised device, whether through confiscation or malware"". According to the Telemetrio database, about 33,000 Telegram channels are active in Ukraine.

At Huawei's flagship shop in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, some who described themselves as Huawei ""super fans"" were annoyed after being told only those whose pre-orders had been confirmed could buy the new, tri-foldable Mate XT. ""I’ve been here since 10 p.m. last night because this tri-folding phone is a first and I'm excited to support our country,"" said a university student surnamed Ye. ""But this is very disappointing. They should have made it clear we can’t buy."" It was a similar story at the Huawei Wangfujing store in Beijing, where consumers were told only those whose pre-orders had been confirmed could buy the much-hyped phone, which folds three ways like an accordion screen door. A shopper surnamed Rui who got to try out the Mate XT in Shenzhen said: ""I wanted to see what the fuss is about, but it’s a bit big, not very practical really."" The disappointment comes after some analysts had warned that supply chain constraints could leave many potential buyers of Huawei's Mate XT empty-handed and others questioned the high cost of the phone amid a sluggish economy. While Huawei executive director Richard Yu said at Mate XT's unveiling this month the company had turned ""science fiction into reality"", owning the phone still remains a fantasy for many. Pre-orders for the Mate XT have surpassed 6.5 million, almost double the roughly 3.9 million foldable smartphones shipped worldwide in the second quarter of this year, according to consultancy IDC. ""Pre-ordering"" does not require consumers to put down a deposit. Huawei did not say how many phones had been produced so far or how many customers would receive the Mate XT on launch day. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on how many new iPhones were available for sale in China on Friday. In the Huaqiangbei electronics market in Shenzhen, a phone stall vendor said she was selling the most expensive version of the Mate XT - with the highest memory - for 150,000 yuan ($21,290), compared to the store price of 23,999 yuan, while she was offering the $2,800 model for more than $4,000. Asked if she had sold any, she replied: ""A few people have asked, but it's far too expensive."" While Apple for years enjoyed strong demand in China, where new iPhone launches once sparked a frenzy, its sales have dwindled and the company's quarterly ranking in the world's No. 2 economy has now dropped from third to sixth place. Apple's new smartphone launch in China has been overshadowed by the fact that it has yet to announce an AI partner in the country to power the 16s, and Apple Intelligence, its AI software, will only be available in Chinese next year. Also read: Buying iPhone in Pakistan is about to get so much simpler – Here’s how! Some Apple fans said the AI challenge was not an issue. ""The lack of AI in iPhones is not currently a major concern for me, as it's more of a gimmick at this stage,"" said a customer surnamed Shi who upgrades his iPhone annually. Speaking about the new offering by Huawei, Shi said it was too expensive and ""not for ordinary customers"". Huawei has received significant patriotic support in China with fans impressed at how the company has managed to overcome years of export controls by the United States that initially crippled its smartphone business. The launch of the Mate XT, which analysts say has a locally-made chipset, underscores Huawei's ability to navigate U.S. sanctions although the company's ability to mass-produce remains a significant concern. Based on recent checks, key components of the Huawei Mate XT, including the panel, cover glass, and hinges, may be facing production yield issues, said Lori Chang, a senior analyst with Isaiah Research."

Well, it turns out that it's not an easy task. When astronauts leave Earth's surface, they lose many of the cues that help them figure out which way is up. This can be dangerous, and that's where training comes in. But now, scientists have come up with a cool solution using wearable gadgets that vibrate to give astronauts a better sense of direction. Dr Vivekanand P. Vimal from Brandeis University in the United States is the brain behind this idea. He explains that long spaceflights can cause lots of stress on astronauts, making them more prone to getting lost in space. And when an astronaut gets disoriented, it's a big problem because they can't rely on their usual senses any more. To see if these wearable gadgets, known as vibrotactors, could help, the scientists ran some tests. They put participants in a situation where their regular senses, like seeing and hearing, were of no use. Instead, they had to rely on these buzzing vibrotactors to guide them and prevent them from crashing into things. The participants were divided into three groups. One group received training on how to balance themselves in a special spinning chair. Another group used vibrotactors, and the third group got both training and vibrotactors. They all wore blindfolds, earplugs, and listened to white noise to make the tests even tougher. Here's how it worked Those with vibrotactors had four of them strapped to each arm. These devices would vibrate whenever the participants started moving away from the balance point. The goal was to keep a special spinning chair as close to balance as possible during 40 trials. The catch was that in half of the trials, the chair mimicked Earth's movements, so the participants could use their natural senses. In the other half, it acted like they were in space, with no gravity to help them. The results were pretty interesting. Everyone felt disoriented at first in the space-like trials. But the participants using vibrotactors did better than those who only received training. The group with both training and vibrotactors performed the best over time. Even so, they couldn't perform as well as they did when Earth's gravity helped them out. Dr Vimal pointed out that trusting these vibrotactors at a deeper, almost instinctive level is essential. This might require some special training to make it work. So, why is all of this important? Well, as space exploration continues, these wearable vibrotactors could be super helpful for astronauts. They might make landing on a planet safer, and they could be a game-changer for astronauts working outside their spacecraft."

This ruling comes as part of several remedies ordered by Judge James Donato in a case brought by Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite. Google intends to appeal the decision and seek a delay in implementing the remedies. The case stems from a December jury verdict in favour of Epic Games, which claimed Google stifled competition by controlling app distribution and payment systems on Android devices. In response, Google argued that the changes would compromise user privacy and security, make app promotion more challenging for developers, and reduce competition on Android devices. Legal experts, however, view the ruling as a significant challenge to the dominance of large tech companies. Rebecca Haw Allensworth of Vanderbilt Law School noted that the ruling shows courts may push dominant platforms to share access with rivals to promote competition. The ruling also requires Google to make its app catalogue available to competing app stores, a move Mark Lemley of Stanford Law School says isn't typically mandated by antitrust law. However, the judge emphasized that once antitrust violations are proven, courts can order actions to undo the harm, even if those actions weren't previously required. Google maintains that its Play Store operates in a competitive market, pointing to competition with Apple, which also faced a lawsuit from Epic Games in 2020. In that case, an appeals court ruled that Apple does not have a monopoly in mobile games. This latest ruling is another in a series of recent legal challenges Google has faced over its market practices. In August, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly in online search. Last month, arguments concluded in a similar case involving Google's dominance in the advertising technology market. Critics argue that Google’s fees, which can reach up to 30% on app store transactions, have led to higher costs for consumers. Lee Hepner, Senior Legal Counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, believes the ruling will encourage more developers to enter the market, ultimately driving down prices for consumers."

"338","Science-Technology","If your AI seems smarter​, it's thanks to smarter human trainers","https://www.samaa.tv/2087321626-if-your-ai-seems-smarter-it-s-thanks-to-smarter-human-trainers","In the early years, getting AI models like ChatGPT or its rival Cohere to spit out human-like responses required vast teams of low-cost workers helping models distinguish basic facts such as if an image was of a car or a carrot. But more sophisticated updates to AI models in the fiercely competitive arena are now demanding a rapidly expanding network of human trainers who have specialized knowledge -- from historians to scientists, some with doctorate degrees. ""A year ago, we could get away with hiring undergraduates, to just generally teach AI on how to improve,"" said Cohere co-founder Ivan Zhang, talking about its internal human trainers. ""Now we have licensed physicians teaching the models how to behave in medical environments, or financial analysts or accountants."" For more training, Cohere, which was last valued at over $5 billion, works with a startup called Invisible Tech. Cohere is one of the main rivals of OpenAI and specializes in AI for businesses. The startup Invisible Tech employs thousands of trainers, working remotely, and has become one of the main partners of AI companies ranging from AI21 to Microsoft to train their AI models to reduce errors, known in the AI world as hallucinations. ""We have 5,000 people in over 100 countries around the world that are PhDs, Master's degree holders and knowledge work specialists,"" said Invisible founder Francis Pedraza. Invisible pays as much as $40 per hour, depending on the location of the worker and the complexity of work. Some companies such as Outlier pay up to $50 per hour, while another company called Labelbox said it pays up to $200 per hour for ""high expertise"" subjects like quantum physics, but starts with $15 for basic topics. Invisible was founded in 2015 as a workflow automation company catering to the likes of food delivery company DoorDash to digitize their delivery menu. But things changed when a relatively unknown research firm called OpenAI contacted them in the spring of 2022, ahead of the public launch of ChatGPT. ""OpenAI came to us with a problem, which is that when you were asking an early version of ChatGPT a question, it was going to hallucinate. You couldn't trust the answer,"" Pedraza told Reuters. ""They needed an advanced AI training partner to provide reinforcement learning with human feedback."" OpenAI did not respond to request for comment. Generative AI produces new content based on past data used to train it. However, sometimes it can't distinguish between true and false information and generates false outputs known as hallucinations. In one notable example, in 2023 a Google chatbot shared inaccurate information about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system in a promotional video. AI companies are aware that hallucinations can derail GenAI's attractiveness to businesses and are trying various ways to reduce it, including using human trainers to teach the concept of fact and fiction. Since getting onboard with OpenAI, Invisible says it has become AI training partners to most of the GenAI companies, including Cohere, AI21 and Microsoft. Cohere and AI21 confirmed they are clients. Microsoft did not confirm it is a client of Invisible. ""These are all companies that had training challenges, where their number one cost was compute power, and then the number two cost is quality training,"" Pedraza said. OpenAI, which started off the frenzy around GenAI, has a team of researchers aptly named ""Human Data Team"" that works with AI trainers to gather specialized data for training its models like ChatGPT. OpenAI researchers come up with various experiments like reducing hallucinations or to improve writing style and work with AI trainers from Invisible and other vendors, a source familiar with the company's processes said. At any point, dozens of experiments are being run, some with tools developed by OpenAI and others by tools of vendors, the person said. Based on what the AI companies want - from getting better at Swedish history or doing financial modeling - Invisible hires workers with relevant degrees for those projects, reducing the burden of managing hundreds of trainers by the AI companies. ""OpenAI has some of the most incredible computer scientists in the world but they're not necessarily an expert in Swedish history or chemistry questions or biology questions or anything you can ask it,"" Pedraza said, adding that over 1,000 contract workers cater to OpenAI alone. Cohere's Zhang said he has personally used Invisible's trainers to find a way to teach its GenAI model to find relevant information from a big data set. Among the competitors in this space is Scale AI, a private start-up last valued at $14 billion which provides AI companies with sets of training data. It has also ventured into the area of providing AI trainers, and counts OpenAI as a customer. Scale AI did not respond to requests for an interview for this story. Invisible, which has been profitable since 2021, has raised only $8 million of primary capital,""We are 70% owned by the team, and only 30% owned by investors,"" Pedraza said. ""We do facilitate secondary rounds, and the most recent traded price was at a half a billion dollar valuation."" Reuters could not confirm that valuation. Human trainers first got into AI training through data-labelling work that required less qualification and was also paid less, sometimes as low as $2, mostly done by people in African and Asian countries. As AI companies launch more advanced models, the demand for specialized trainers and across dozens of languages is on the rise, creating a well-paid niche where workers from a variety of subjects could become AI trainers without even knowing how to code. Demand from AI companies is leading to the creation of more companies that are offering similar services. ""My inbox is basically inundated with new firms that pop up here and there. I do see this as a new space where companies hire humans just to create data for AI labs like us,"" Zhang said."

U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California, dismissed nearly all claims based on the ""Allow Apps to Request to Track"" setting on Apple mobile devices, but let some claims proceed over the ""Share [Device] Analytics"" setting. Mobile device users said Apple violated their user agreements and several privacy and consumer protection laws by assuring that disabling the settings would limit its collection, storage and use of their data - only to then ignore their choices and collect, store and use that data. The lawsuit seeking unspecified damages is one of many accusing technology companies such as Apple, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms' Facebook of allowing the collection of user data without consent. In a 39-page decision late Thursday, Davila said Apple made clear to users that the ""Allow Apps to Request to Track"" setting applied to ""other companies' apps and websites."" He said that made it ""implausible"" for reasonable people to believe that by turning the setting off, they were withdrawing consent for Apple to collect their data through its own apps. But the judge said users plausibly alleged they withdrew such consent by disabling the ""Share [Device] Analytics"" setting, citing Apple's disclosure that users may ""disable the sharing of Device Analytics altogether."" The Cupertino, California-based company has said it collects data through that setting to improve its products and services. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.

Starliner's debut crewed mission, a high-stakes test now planned for June 1, was derailed earlier this month by a small helium leak detected in its propulsion system hours before it was due to lift off from Florida. Over two weeks of extra scrutiny found that the leak poses no major risk to the astronauts, officials said. ""This is really not a safety of flight issue for ourselves, and we believe that we have a well-understood condition that we can manage,"" Boeing's Starliner boss Mark Nappi told reporters during a news conference. Starliner's long-delayed first crewed flight, with NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on board, is a final test mission before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut trips to and from the International Space Station. It would become the second U.S. crew capsule alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which started flying humans in 2020. Boeing and NASA's probe of the helium leak led engineers to uncover an additional issue in Starliner's propulsion system that NASA's commercial crew chief Steve Stich called a ""design vulnerability."" Also read: Parade of planets: Where to watch the 6-planet alignment on June 3 Modeling showed that a cascading, but very unlikely, series of issues during a mission could eliminate the capsule's backup thrusters and render it unable to safely return to Earth. A software fix offered a temporary workaround for the mission, but Boeing and NASA will discuss whether a deeper redesign is needed before future flights, officials said. ""It's backed by test data, it's backed by flight data, and the guidance and navigation modeling have reinforced that this technique will work,"" Nappi said, adding the astronauts had tested the system after the fix. That broader issue and ad hoc resolution prompted NASA to call for an additional Flight Readiness Review, an extensive, day-long meeting among agency officials, Boeing engineers and independent analysts to justify Starliner is safe for flight. That meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, three days before Boeing's target launch time on June 1, 12:25 PM ET. If needed Starliner also has opportunities to fly June 2, 5 and 6. Boeing, which initially attempted to launch Starliner May 6, faces pressure to make one of those early June dates. Anything later than June 6 could trigger weeks or potentially months of more delays because some perishable items would need to be replaced on Starliner and its Atlas 5 rocket, built by the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA). That would begin to clash with other scheduled priorities ULA has on its launch pad, such as Amazon's first launch of its Kuiper satellites and ULA's second flight of its new Vulcan rocket, a long-delayed demonstration that would allow it to start launching Pentagon missions. Boeing is a longtime NASA contractor that has built modules for the decades-old International Space Station but has never before flown humans into space, a feat that persistent struggles in its Starliner program has made elusive. Years behind schedule and with $1.5 billion in unplanned development costs, a success with Starliner is badly needed as Boeing reels from unrelenting crises in its aviation business. Starliner in 2019 failed an attempt to reach the ISS, returning to Earth roughly a week earlier than planned because of dozens of software, technical and management issues that reshaped Boeing's relationship with NASA. The spacecraft succeeded in a re-do flight in 2022 to the ISS."
"342","Science-Technology","Parade of planets: Where to watch the 6-planet alignment on June 3","https://www.samaa.tv/2087315245-parade-of-planets-where-to-watch-the-6-planet-alignment-on-june-3","Stargazers, get ready! On June 3, you'll have the chance to see Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune line up in a stunning planetary parade. On this special night, you can observe up to six planets, depending on where you are. Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn will be visible with the naked eye, but to spot Uranus and Neptune, you'll need high-powered binoculars or a telescope. Look for Uranus near Mercury and Neptune close to Saturn. This is the second planetary parade of the year, following the one during the 2024 solar eclipse. Those in the path of totality saw Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and Mars, though Mars and Saturn were a bit tricky to spot.  In the U.S., New York state offers the best viewing spot on the morning of June 3, between 5 a.m. ET and just before sunrise at 5:26 a.m. This brief window is crucial, especially if you plan to set up a telescope to catch all six planets. Other parts of the eastern seaboard will also have good views at different times. In Florida, you can see Saturn, Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter just before sunrise around 6 a.m. In Ohio, the same group will be visible around 5:40 a.m. While other parts of the country might see fewer planets, we’ll guide you on how to check for your specific location. Although Venus will be in the sky, it will be too close to the sun to see. The six-planet parade will be visible every morning for about a week. Eventually, Mercury will move too close to the sun to be visible, and the more distant planets will fade from view. However, Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn will remain visible in the early morning sky for several weeks.  To determine the best viewing times and locations, use online tools like Stellarium's website and the Sky Tonight app (available on iOS and Android). Enter your location, set the time between June 3 and June 7, and adjust between sunset and sunrise. The Sky Tonight app shows planetary positions regardless of visibility, while Stellarium shows what the sky will look like from your location. In ideal viewing locations, you can see four planets with the naked eye: Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, and Mercury. However, to see Neptune and Uranus, you’ll need high-powered binoculars or a telescope. The bright sky just before dawn and their distance from Earth make these planets harder to spot without extra equipment. Photographing this event is challenging and requires special filters for good detail, but it can be rewarding. Even if you can’t see all six planets, spotting three or four is still a fantastic experience. Remember, cloudy weather and city lights can interfere with your view. A planetary parade is when planets line up visually in the night sky. NASA often calls this a ""parade of planets."" A planetary alignment can mean either this visual lineup or an actual orbital alignment, which is very rare. The upcoming event is a visual alignment, where the planets appear lined up from Earth but aren't in a literal orbital alignment. Smaller planetary parades occur frequently, but seeing five or more planets at once is rare. Here are upcoming dates through 2025 for these celestial events: - June 3, 2024- August 28, 2024- January 18, 2025- February 28, 2025- August 29, 2025 The parade on February 28, 2025, is especially noteworthy as all seven other planets in our solar system will be visible, though you’ll need a telescope for some. Don't miss this rare and beautiful celestial event. Use these tips and tools to make the most of your planet parade viewing experience!"

In swift response, Rockstar promptly released the trailer on its official YouTube channel. Our trailer has leaked so please watch the real thing on YouTube: https://t.co/T0QOBDHwBe  The trailer affirms various details that have gradually surfaced about GTA VI over the past two years, confirming the return to Vice City and the inclusion of the series' inaugural female protagonist, featuring a narrative inspired by Bonnie and Clyde. The trailer discloses a 2025 release date, and Rockstar, in a subsequent press release on Monday, clarified that the game is slated for release on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S that year. A decade in the making, GTA VI's debut trailer could have been a mere depiction of the Roman numeral for six, sparking discussions and speculation for an indefinite period. Fortunately, the trailer exceeded these expectations, showcasing GTA staples such as high-speed chases, chaotic gunfights, stacks of illicit money, and illustration of American-style ethics, all set against the backdrop of Vice City, a fictionalised representation of Miami. The trailer spotlights a lone protagonist, Lucia, a woman initially seen in a prison jumpsuit, hinting at her involvement in criminal activities alongside her boyfriend upon release.

Nvidia's stock market value briefly touched $3.53 trillion, slightly above Apple's $3.52 trillion, LSEG data showed. Nvidia ended the day up 0.8%, with a market value of $3.47 trillion, while Apple's shares rose 0.4%, valuing the iPhone maker at $3.52 trillion. In June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months. Microsoft's market value stood at $3.18 trillion, with its stock up 0.8%. The Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other heavyweights to dominate the emerging technology. Known since the 1990s as a designer of processors for videogames, Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion. Nvidia and other semiconductor stocks got a lift on Friday after data storage maker Western Digital reported quarterly profit that beat analysts' estimates, buoying optimism about data center demand. ""More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""It is certainly in a sweet spot and so long as we avoid a big economic downturn in the United States, there is a feeling that companies will continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities, creating a healthy tailwind for Nvidia."" Nvidia's shares hit a record high on Tuesday, building on a rally from last week when TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted a forecast-beating 54% jump in quarterly profit driven by soaring demand for chips used in AI. Meanwhile, Apple is struggling with tepid demand for its smartphones. iPhone sales in China slipped 0.3% in the third quarter, while sales of phones made by rival Huawei surged 42%. With Apple set to report its quarterly results on Thursday, analysts on average see its revenue climbing 5.55% year over year to $94.5 billion, LSEG data showed. That compares with analysts' projections for Nvidia of nearly 82% revenue growth to $32.9 billion. Shares of Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft have an outsized influence on the richly valued technology sector as well as the broader U.S. stock market, with the trio accounting for about a fifth of the S&P 500 index's weight. Optimism about the prospects for AI, expectations that the Federal Reserve will considerably bring down U.S. interest rates, and most recently, an upbeat start to the earnings season, helped lift the benchmark S&P 500 to an all-time high last week. Nvidia's massive gains have helped boost the stock's appeal for option traders and the company's options are among the most traded on any given day in recent months, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert. The stock has surged nearly 190% so far this year as the boom in generative AI led to a series of blowout forecasts from Nvidia. ""The question is whether the revenue stream will last for a long time and will be driven by the emotion of investors rather than by any ability to prove or disprove the thesis that AI is overdone,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""I think Nvidia knows that near term, their numbers are likely to be quite remarkable."""

Apple reached second place with a 15.6% market share, though down 0.5 percentage points year-on-year, while Huawei claimed third place with 15.3%, gaining 4.2 percentage points, showed data from researcher IDC on Friday. Vivo, which primarily sells budget phones, was the top vendor with a market share of 18.6%. The contrasting performances follow Huawei's comeback last year in the premium segment with its Mate 60 series, featuring what analysts said is a domestically produced chip.

Apple has faced additional headwind in China, including restrictions on iPhone use by some government agencies. The U.S. tech giant has since responded with multiple discount campaigns to boost sales. The third-quarter performance was partly helped by the new iPhone 16, which went on sale on Sept. 20. On the same day, Huawei launched a competing product- a tri-foldable phone. The new iPhones got off to a strong start in China, with sales 20% higher in the first three weeks since launch compared with the 2023 models, showed separate data from researcher Counterpoint. ""With its annual new product launch, Apple returned to China's top five market rankings with a 15.6% market share,"" IDC said. ""With subsequent increases in market promotions and the launch of Apple Vision Pro, the market demand for the iPhone 16 series is expected to gradually materialise in the future.""

This move marks an unusual step for Gates, who typically keeps his political contributions under wraps and has not publicly endorsed Harris. According to a report, Gates's decision to contribute stems from his concerns over the possible re-election of former President Donald Trump. He fears a second term for Trump could jeopardize critical programs such as global health initiatives and family planning efforts, which are key areas of focus for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Despite his willingness to collaborate with any candidate, Gates has indicated that the upcoming 2024 election carries unique significance. He was quoted as saying, “I support candidates who show a commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty, and fighting climate change.” Notably, Gates’s donation will not appear in public campaign finance records, as it was funneled through Future Forward USA Action, a ‘dark money’ organization that does not disclose its donors. This has sparked interest due to the lack of transparency in the funding. The donation also comes at a pivotal time in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. With digital currencies becoming a mainstream issue, Vice President Harris and other candidates are focusing on economic policies, including potential crypto regulations. While Gates has expressed caution regarding cryptocurrencies, he acknowledges their potential to empower underbanked populations—a cause that aligns with his philanthropic goals. "

Previously, WhatsApp relied solely on users' phone contact books to manage connections. When a new contact messaged a user, the information would only be stored locally on their device. The upcoming feature, rolling out soon, will allow users to save contacts accessible on any device, including WhatsApp for web and Windows, while still offering the option to sync these contacts to their mobile devices. This update follows last year’s introduction of the ability to log into two WhatsApp accounts on a single device, providing users the flexibility to maintain separate personal and business contact lists. It also caters to those who share devices with others, allowing them to keep their contact information private. WhatsApp developed a new encrypted storage system called Identity Proof Linked Storage (IPLS) for this feature, generating an encryption key on the user's device to ensure secure contact storage. Additionally, the app is collaborating with Cloudflare to guarantee the integrity of the contact data by signing any changes made to the user’s directory. In an exciting twist, WhatsApp is also working on enabling users to save contacts by usernames, adding an extra layer of privacy. This means users can interact without needing to share their phone numbers, similar to features offered by rivals like Signal and Telegram. With this new feature, WhatsApp aims to enhance user privacy and convenience, reinforcing its commitment to evolving in a competitive messaging landscape."

The company, widely seen as the winner of Hollywood's streaming wars, was set to add around $18 billion to its market value of about $295 billion, based on premarket share movements. It topped estimates for quarterly subscriber additions by more than 1 million and projected higher sign-ups sequentially for the last three months of the year when Korean drama ""Squid Game"" returns. The company's profit and revenue also beat estimates, a positive sign for its efforts to shift investor focus away from subscriber growth amid what some analysts see as an inevitable slowdown in sign-ups after the success of its password-sharing curbs. The 5.1 million users Netflix added in the third quarter were below the 8.76 million additions in the year-ago period. ""The third quarter showed the slowdown in subscriber growth that we've been expecting, but Netflix has other areas of opportunity to continue boosting its financial performance,"" Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin said. Part of the push includes price increases. After increasing fees in Japan, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as parts of Europe, in recent weeks, Netflix is hiking prices in Italy and Spain, and some analysts expect a similar move in the U.S. next year. ""Netflix did not announce any price change, though it did hint that there is room to take price with stronger engagement,"" Bernstein analysts said. The ad-supported tier also showed signs of progress as it accounted for more than 50% of sign-ups in countries where it was available in the third quarter, though Netflix does not expect advertising to become a primary growth driver until 2026. At least eight analysts raised their price targets on the stock following results, bringing the median target to $750 from $706.38, according to data compiled by LSEG.  "

While Meta did not disclose the exact number of layoffs, this move appears to be a continuation of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s ""Year of Efficiency,"" which he initiated last year. Since that announcement, Meta has cut over 10,000 jobs as part of a broader cost-reduction strategy and a pivot away from the Metaverse focus. Interestingly, the layoffs follow a release of better-than-expected financial results for the second quarter.

Musk, CEO of Starlink, has voiced his opposition to auctioning the spectrum, calling it an ""unprecedented"" move that contradicts international norms. Musk took to X, the social media platform he owns, to argue that the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) designates this spectrum as shared for satellites. He stressed that the allocation should be handled “rationally, efficiently, and economically.” Musk's stance contrasts with that of Reliance Industries, led by Ambani, which has reportedly lobbied for an auction-based allocation system. Starlink, along with other global players like Amazon’s Project Kuiper, advocates for administrative allocation—where the spectrum is assigned without an auction. They argue that this aligns with global best practices and would speed up the growth of satellite broadband in India. Reliance, on the other hand, has reportedly sent a private letter to India’s Telecom Regulatory Authority (Trai), challenging its inclination towards administrative allocation. Reliance contends that an auction would ensure a level playing field, especially with international companies like Starlink entering the market. As Trai continues public consultations, the debate highlights the growing importance of satellite broadband in India, a market projected to reach $1.9 billion by 2030."

"375","Science-Technology","TikTok faces tough questions from court over challenge to US law","https://www.samaa.tv/2087320952-tiktok-faces-tough-questions-from-court-over-challenge-to-us-law","A lawyer for TikTok and Chinese parent company ByteDance sought on Monday to convince a federal appeals court to block a US law that would ban the short video app used by 170 million Americans as soon as Jan 19, arguing that it violates free speech protections, but faced tough questions from the judges. A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard two hours of arguments in the lawsuit filed by TikTok and ByteDance in May seeking an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect. Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny pressed the US government's stance that TikTok, under Chinese ownership, poses a national security threat because of its access to vast amounts of personal data on Americans, asserting that China can covertly manipulate information that Americans consume via the popular app. Andrew Pincus, the lawyer arguing for TikTok and ByteDance, told Judges Sri Srinivasan, Neomi Rao and Douglas Ginsburg that the U.S. government had not demonstrated that TikTok actually poses national security risks. Pincus also argued that the law violates the U.S. Constitution on a number of grounds, including running afoul of the First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech. ""The law before this court is unprecedented, and its effect would be staggering,"" Pincus told the judges, saying ""for the first time in history, Congress has expressly targeted a specific U.S. speaker banning its speech and the speech of 170 million Americans."" The law gives ByteDance until Jan. 19 to sell or divest TikTok's US assets or face a ban in the United States. Driven by worries that China could access data on Americans or spy on them with the app, the U.S. Congress passed the measure with overwhelming support and President Joe Biden signed it into law in April. The lawsuit claimed that if the statute is upheld, it would show that Congress can circumvent the First Amendment ""by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down."" Tenny defended the law and warned of Chinese manipulation efforts. ""It's farcical to suggest that with this two billion lines of code - 40 times as big as the entire Windows operating system, changed 1,000 times every day - that somehow we're going to detect that they've changed it,"" Tenny said. ""There is so much happening in China outside the control of the United States that it poses a grave national security risk."" Rao cited an estimate that it could take three years to review the source code, not including updates. ""So how are you supposed to have disclosure, or verified disclosure?"" Rao asked Pincus. Rao said many of TikTok's arguments appear to want the court to treat Congress as an executive branch agency, rather than a legislature that ""actually passed a law."" ""It's a very strange framework"" for thinking about Congress, the judge added. Ginsburg asked why is this any different from another U.S. law that precludes foreign ownership of a broadcast license. Srinivasan, in questioning Pincus, raised the hypothetical situation of the United States being at war with China, and whether Congress in that situation could bar foreign ownership of major media outlets operating in the United States. Pincus said Congress probably would be able to do so, but noted that lawmakers did not include that justification in the current law. The law prohibits app stores like Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), opens new tab from offering TikTok and bars internet hosting services from supporting TikTok unless ByteDance divests TikTok by the deadline. Under the law, Biden could extend the deadline by three months if he certifies ByteDance is making significant progress toward a sale. TikTok and the Justice Department have asked for a ruling by Dec. 6, which could allow the U.S. Supreme Court to consider any appeal before a ban takes effect. The case is playing out during the final weeks of the U.S. presidential campaign. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, are active on TikTok, seeking to court younger voters. The White House has said it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national security grounds, but not a ban on TikTok. Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to ban TikTok in 2020, has said if elected in November he would not allow TikTok to be barred."

South Korea-based Samsung has instructed subsidiaries worldwide to reduce sales and marketing staff by about 15% and the administrative staff by up to 30%, two of the sources said. The plan will be implemented by the end of this year and would impact jobs across the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa, one person said. Six other people familiar with the matter also confirmed Samsung's planned global headcount reduction. It is not clear how many people would be let go and which countries and business units would be most affected. The sources declined to be named because the scope and details of the job cuts remained confidential. In a statement, Samsung said workforce adjustments conducted at some overseas operations were routine, and aimed at improving efficiency. It said there are no specific targets for the plans, adding that they are not impacting its production staff. Samsung employed a total of 267,800 people as of the end of 2023, and more than half, or 147,000 employees, are based overseas, according to its latest sustainability report. Manufacturing and development accounted for most of those jobs and sales and marketing staff was around 25,100, while 27,800 people worked in other areas, the report said. The ""global mandate"" on job cuts was sent about three weeks ago, and Samsung's India operation was already offering severance packages to some mid-level employees who have left in recent weeks, one of the direct sources said. The total employees who may need to leave the India unit could reach 1,000, the person added. Samsung employs some 25,000 people in India. In China, Samsung has notified its staff about the job cuts that are expected to affect about 30% of its employees at its sales operation, a South Korean newspaper reported this month. Big challenges The job cuts come as Samsung grapples with mounting pressure on its key units. Its bread-and-butter chip business has been slower than its rivals in recovering from a severe downturn in the industry that drove its profit to a 15-year low last year. In May, Samsung replaced the head of its semiconductor division in a bid to overcome a ""chip crisis"" as it seeks to catch up with smaller rival SK Hynix in supplying high-end memory chips used in artificial intelligence chipsets. In the premium smartphone market, Samsung is facing stiff competition from Apple and China's Huawei, while it has long lagged behind TSMC in contract chip manufacturing. And in India, which earns Samsung around $12 billion in annual revenue, a strike over wages is disrupting production. One of the sources familiar with the plans said the job cuts were being made in preparation for a slowdown in global demand for technology products as the global economy slows. Another source said Samsung is seeking to shore up its bottom line by saving costs. It was not immediately clear if Samsung will also cut jobs in its headquarters, South Korea. One of the sources said Samsung would find it difficult to lay off workers in South Korea because it was a politically sensitive issue. Conglomerate Samsung Group, of which the electronics giant is the crown jewel, is the country's biggest employer and plays a key role in its economy. Job cuts could also stir labour unrest at home. A South Korean workers' union at Samsung Electronics recently went on strike for several days, demanding higher wages and benefits. Shares in Samsung Electronics, South Korea's most valuable stock, are trading at their lowest level in 16 months on Wednesday, as some analysts cut their profit estimates for the company recently, citing a weak recovery in demand for smartphones and personal computers."

Apple's shares fell 1.7% on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. tech giant unveiled its new iPhones that sport hardware-level integration for applications based on artificial intelligence but with limited changes to the external design. The phones will use AI features - dubbed Apple Intelligence - to improve the company's voice assistant Siri as well as enhance the camera. Those features will arrive on U.S. iPhones in beta next month, potentially keeping people from upgrading to iPhone 16s soon. ""With lots of words like ""later this year"" and ""early next year"", the core Apple message for iPhone 16 was: Next year will be better,"" Needham analyst Laura Martin said in a note. Apple did not say when it would move beyond the test phase, nor did it announce a partner in China to help power its AI ambitions. The lack of AI features in the new iPhones drew scorn in China, where the government has mandated that generative AI-based chatbots need to be vetted before their public release. The hashtag ""iPhone 16 Chinese version doesn't support AI yet"" attracted 11.33 million views and over 1,500 comments on Weibo. ""What's the point of buying it if you can't use AI?"" wrote one Weibo user. Another commented, ""Without AI as the biggest selling point, it should be half price."" Apple did not raise prices for the new iPhones, which Wall Street analysts said was a good strategy as consumers are not willing to splurge on big-ticket items. Huawei, which showed off its new Mate XT smartphone hours after the Apple event, has priced the tri-fold device at $2,800. ""Production constraints and the high price point mean the new (Huawei) phone will likely not have a huge impact in terms of shipments,"" said Will Wong, senior researcher at consultancy IDC. ""But it's telling the consumers that it's still the tech leader and the potential challenge it brings to Apple may be far beyond just market share."" Comeback Mate XT has already received more than 4 million pre-orders, for which no deposit is required, according to the company's website. It boasts an AI assistant with text summary, translation and editing functions, as well as AI-boosted image editing functions such as trimming unwanted parts of photos. Huawei's string of successful smartphone launches in recent months underscores the company's ability to navigate U.S. sanctions and solidifies its position against Apple in China. In contrast, Apple's sales have slowed in the country after seeing strong growth for years, and its ranking in the world's second-largest economy has now dropped from third to sixth place. IPhone shipments in China fell by 6.7% in the second quarter of 2024, according to data from Canalys. Huawei made a comeback to the high-end smartphone segment last year with the release of a device powered by a domestically made chip, defying U.S. sanctions that have cut off its access to the global chipset supply chain. The launch of the Mate 60 Pro surprised analysts and U.S. officials. Both the Mate XT and iPhone 16 go on sale on Sept 20."

Apple is set to host its fall event on Sept 9 at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where it will likely unveil a series of new iPhones and updates to other devices and apps. Apple signed a deal with Arm in September last year that ""extends beyond 2040"" in a boost for Arm for chip technology. Arm had said in July that its V9 chip accounts for 50% of smartphone revenue. Arm owns the intellectual property behind the computing architecture for most of the world's smartphones, which it licenses to Apple and many others. Apple uses Arm's technology in the process of designing its own custom chips for its iPhones, iPads and Macs. The two companies have a long history - Apple was one of the initial companies that partnered to found the firm in 1990, before the release of its ""Newton"" handheld computer in 1993, which used an Arm-based processor chip. The Newton flopped, but Arm went on to become dominant in mobile phone chips because of its low power consumption, which helps batteries last longer. "

The Casio F-91W is the most popular digital watch in the world. It was released in 1989 and is still in production today. It is known for its low price and long battery life. Osama bin Laden was often photographed wearing a Casio F-91W watch. It is believed that he wore the watch because of its functionality and durability. Former US president Barack Obama was also seen wearing a Casio F-91W watch on several occasions. Reasons for fame Durability: It is known for its ability to withstand extreme conditions which makes it a popular choice for military and law enforcement personnel.Simple design: It has a simple and minimalist design that appeals to many people.Functionality: It has a number of useful features, such as a stopwatch, alarm clock, and calendar. Iconic status: It has become an iconic watch, worn by people from all walks of life. In addition to these reasons, the Casio F-91W has also been featured in a number of movies and TV shows, which has helped to increase its popularity. Here are some specific examples of how the Casio F-91W has been featured in popular culture: In the film ""The Matrix"", Neo is seen wearing a Casio F-91W watch. In the TV show ""Breaking Bad"", Walter White is seen wearing a Casio F-91W watch. In the music video for the song ""Lose Yourself"" by Eminem, the rapper is seen wearing a Casio F-91W watch. Use in terror activities?The US government got suspicious of Afghans who wore Casio watches because they could use them to time bombs, which al-Qaeda often did. Secret documents given to Guantanamo Bay interrogators and published by The Guardian said the Casio F-91W watch was considered a sign of al-Qaeda and contributed to detaining prisoners at the jail. Training materials for assessing new detainees suggested that owning an F-91W or A159W, which could be bought online for as little as $4, might mean the person had received bomb-making training from al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.  US military intelligence recognized the F-91W as a watch that terrorists used to create time bombs. Casio watches were mentioned in about 150 prisoner assessments at Guantanamo."

Renowned analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that the star of the event will be the M3 series MacBook Pro, possibly accompanied by the unveiling of an Apple M3 iMac. I believe M3 series MacBook Pro will be Oct 30th media event's focus. I previously predicted a launch this year is unlikely due to limited 4Q23 shipments (less than 400-500k units in total). If new MBPs launch in Nov-Dec, tight supply will last into 1Q24 unless demand weakens. pic.twitter.com/R6tVIYyQop  It's clear that Apple is sharpening in on its all-new M3 models, explaining the event's emphasis on speed. While the specifics of the hardware to be unveiled remain somewhat veiled in mystery, it's likely that we'll see a range of MacBook Pro options, potentially in 13-inch, 14-inch, or 16-inch configurations. One intriguing aspect of the M3 MacBook Pro is the possibility of enhanced graphical capabilities, including hardware ray tracing. This feature, which was introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro with the A17 Pro chip, could be a game-changer for MacBook users, aligning the laptops with the capabilities of their mobile counterparts."

This innovative concept aims to transform glass into a cutting-edge data storage solution. As of fall 2023, Microsoft is set to unveil the workings of this visionary project, complete with a robotic system that retrieves data from glass sheets. Here's how Project Silica works, its benefits, applications, and costs. Glass's primary advantage as a data storage medium is its incredible durability. Microsoft's Project Silica uses a femtosecond laser to etch data onto the glass, creating 3D units called ""voxels."" A computer-controlled microscope interprets this encoded data, which is then stored in a library on glass sheets. These sheets remain offline until accessed. Robots in the library move vertically and horizontally to locate and transport the data to the reader. Once data is printed onto the glass and placed in the library, it becomes changeless, making it ideal for preserving content like books, music, and movies. A single glass plate can store several terabytes of data, equivalent to approximately 3,500 movies, or around 1.75 million songs. While Project Silica shows immense potential, its cost is a key consideration. It may find use in preserving personal photos and videos for data-conscious users, but it's not ready for commercial adoption yet. Microsoft outlines that the technology needs ""3-4 more developmental stages."" Project Silica collaborates with the Microsoft Azure team to explore sustainable data storage approaches. It also collaborates with Elire to create a Global Music Vault in Svalbard, Norway. This vault can withstand extreme conditions and is highly durable. While initial costs may be relatively high, Project Silica holds promise for the future. As the technology matures and scales, costs are expected to decrease significantly."

David Zinser, Intel's CFO, alluded to an upcoming ""Windows refresh"" expected to launch next year. This seemingly confirms previous reports that Microsoft was planning to release the next version of Windows in 2024 after a significant internal restructuring of its Windows development timeline. In a conversation with Citi, Zinser stated, ""We actually think '24 is going to be a pretty good year for the client, in particular, because of the Windows refresh. And we still think that the installed base is pretty old and does require a refresh, and we think next year may be the start of that, given the Windows catalyst. So we're optimistic about how things will play out beginning in '24."" This quote is noteworthy because it indirectly confirms the arrival of a major Windows update in the coming year, potentially referred to as ""Windows 12."" The term ""refresh"" was also used during the development of Windows 11 before its official unveiling in June 2021. Recent reports suggest that development on the next Windows version, which is said to have multiple internal codenames, has intensified in recent months. Active development is reportedly in full swing, with most of the work expected to be completed by mid-2024. Sources indicate that the next Windows will place a strong emphasis on deeper integration of AI and cloud experiences, aiming to enhance Windows productivity. Additionally, an updated interface is in the works, along with various quality-of-life improvements and changes. Importantly, the operating system itself is not expected to require a subscription for use.

Taiwan frequently accuses Chinese groups of seeking to spread online disinformation or carry out cyberattacks across the democratically governed island. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has ramped up military and political pressure against over the past five years to assert its claims. The hacking group's X account said it was set up in June 2023 and showed screenshots of efforts to broadcast videos likening Chinese President Xi Jinping to an emperor, marking the second anniversary of protests against Beijing's strict COVID curbs and commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations. One video was an address from an Anonymous 64 member wearing the Anonymous hacking group's Guy Fawkes mask in the style of the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta.

Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council had no immediate comment. Reuters was not immediately able to verify where the group was based or whether they had actually carried out the hacking attacks they were accused of. In the blog post published on its official WeChat account, the most popular social media platform in China, the national security ministry said its investigation into the group had found many of the websites Anonymous 64 claimed to have accessed were fake or had little no traffic, and that its posts showing it having infiltrated numerous university and media websites had been photoshopped. The security ministry published screenshots of the group's X account with heavily redacted text. It also said it had opened a case against three members of Taiwan's cyber warfare wing. ""We advocate that netizens should not believe in or spread rumours and should promptly report cyberattacks or cases of anti-propaganda activity to the national security authorities,"" the blog post said."

The purported creator of the chatbots told a security researcher, who alerted Reuters to the issue, that private details of millions of people were for sale and that samples could be viewed by asking the chatbots to divulge. Star Health and Allied Insurance, whose market capitalization exceeds $4 billion, in a statement to Reuters said it has reported alleged unauthorized data access to local authorities. It said an initial assessment showed ""no widespread compromise"" and that ""sensitive customer data remains secure"". Using the chatbots, Reuters was able to download policy and claims documents featuring names, phone numbers, addresses, tax details, copies of ID cards, test results and medical diagnoses. The ability for users to create chatbots is widely credited with helping Dubai-based Telegram become one of the world's biggest messenger apps with 900 million active monthly users. However, the arrest of Russian-born founder Pavel Durov in France last month has increased scrutiny of Telegram's content moderation and features open to abuse for criminal ends. Durov and Telegram denied wrongdoing and are addressing the criticism. The use of Telegram chatbots to sell stolen data demonstrates the difficulty the app has in preventing nefarious agents taking advantage of its technology and highlights the challenges Indian companies face in keeping their data safe. The Star Health chatbots feature a welcome message stating they are ""by xenZen"" and have been operational since at least Aug. 6, said UK-based security researcher Jason Parker. Parker said he posed as a potential buyer on a online hacker forum where a user under the alias xenZen said they made the chatbots and possessed 7.24 terabytes of data related to over 31 million Star Health customers. The data is free via the chatbot on a random, piecemeal basis, but for sale in bulk form. Reuters could neither independently verify xenZen's claims nor ascertain how the chatbot creator obtained the data. In an email to Reuters, xenZen said they were in discussions with buyers without disclosing who or why they were interested. In testing the bots, Reuters downloaded more than 1,500 files with some documents dated as recently as July 2024. ""If this bot gets taken down watch out and another one will be made available in few hours,"" the welcome message read. The chatbots were later marked ""SCAM"" with a stock warning that users had reported them as suspect. Reuters shared details of the chatbots with Telegram on Sept. 16 and within 24 hours spokesperson Remi Vaughn said they had been ""taken down"" and asked to be informed should more appear. ""The sharing of private information on Telegram is expressly forbidden and is removed whenever it is found. Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring, AI tools and user reports to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day."" New chatbots have since appeared offering Star Health data. Star Health said an unidentified person contacted it on Aug. 13 claiming to have access to some of its data. The insurer reported the matter to the cybercrime department of its home state of Tamil Nadu and federal cyber security agency CERT-In. ""The unauthorized acquisition and dissemination of customer data is illegal, and we are actively working with law enforcement to address this criminal activity. Star Health assures its customers and partners that their privacy is of paramount importance to us,"" it said in its statement. In an Aug. 14 stock exchange filing, Star Health, India's biggest player among standalone health insurance providers, said it was investigating an alleged breach of ""a few claims data"". Representatives for CERT-In and the Tamil Nadu cybercrime department did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Telegram allows individuals or organizations to store and share large amounts of data behind anonymous accounts. It also lets them create customizable chatbots which automatically provide content and features based on user requests. Two chatbots distribute Star Health data. One offers claim documents in PDF format. The other allows users to request up to 20 samples from 31.2 million datasets with a single click giving details including policy number, name and even body mass index. Among documents disclosed to Reuters were records related to the treatment of the one-year-old daughter of policyholder Sandeep TS at a hospital in the southern state of Kerala. The records included diagnosis, blood test results, medical history and a bill of nearly 15,000 rupees ($179). ""It sounds concerning. Do you know how this can affect me?"" said Sandeep, confirming the documents' authenticity. He said Star Health had not notified him of any data leak. The chatbot also leaked a claim last year by policyholder Pankaj Subhash Malhotra which included ultrasound imaging test results, details of illness and copies of federal tax account and national ID cards. He also confirmed the documents were genuine and said he was not made aware of any security breach. The Star Health chatbots are part of a broader trend of hackers using such methods to sell stolen data. Of five million people whose data was sold via chatbots, India represented the largest number of victims at 12%, showed the latest survey on the epidemic conducted by NordVPN at the end of 2022. ""The fact that sensitive data is available via Telegram is natural, because Telegram is an easy-to-use storefront,"" said NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven. ""Telegram has become an easier to use method for criminals to interact."""

As the moon aligns perfectly with the sun, plunging regions into temporary darkness, NASA scientists stationed in Virginia are gearing up to seize this rare opportunity. Rather than merely observing the celestial spectacle, they aim to propel scientific understanding forward by studying the impact of sudden sunlight deprivation on Earth's atmospheric layers. ""The abrupt transition from day to night during a solar eclipse triggers dramatic changes in temperature and behavior, akin to nature's own spectacle,"" remarked Dr. Aroh Barjatya, a distinguished professor of engineering and physics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""Our comprehension of these phenomena remains incomplete, particularly concerning the ionosphere—a crucial region that interfaces between Earth's upper and lower atmospheres."" Indeed, the ionosphere, spanning from 55 to 310 miles above Earth's surface, plays a pivotal role in regulating global communications and navigation systems. Yet, the intricate interplay between solar radiation, ionization, and atmospheric dynamics during periods of rapid darkness remains largely unexplored. Drawing an analogy, Dr. Barjatya likened the eclipse's impact on the ionosphere to a sudden disturbance in a tranquil pond. ""Imagine the ionosphere as a serene pond, gently stirred by natural forces. The eclipse then serves as a disruptive force, akin to a speeding motorboat that creates a wake beneath it,"" he elaborated. ""This phenomenon generates a ripple effect, altering the ionosphere's composition and behavior in ways yet to be fully understood."" NASA's forthcoming rocket launches aim to illuminate these mysteries, shedding light on the ionospheric response to transient darkness. By deploying specialized instruments onboard the rockets, scientists hope to capture real-time data on ion densities, electron fluxes, and atmospheric dynamics during the eclipse's fleeting moments. ""This initiative represents a landmark endeavor in our quest to unravel the intricacies of Earth's atmosphere,"" declared Dr. Ellen Morrison, lead researcher at NASA's Ionospheric Studies Division. ""By harnessing the unique conditions presented by the solar eclipse, we're poised to unveil new insights into the fundamental processes shaping our planet's atmospheric envelope."" As anticipation mounts for the celestial spectacle on April 8, NASA's groundbreaking mission stands as a testament to humanity's enduring quest for knowledge. Amidst the cosmic dance between sun, moon, and Earth, scientists embark on a voyage of discovery, driven by curiosity and a relentless pursuit of understanding."

Found across continents and even on the red plains of Mars, star dunes have remained enigmatic, their formation shrouded in mystery until now. In a collaborative effort between experts at the University of Aberystwyth and Birkbeck University, led by Professors Geoff Duller and Charles Bristow, a remarkable breakthrough has been achieved. The focal point of this revelation is the Lala Lallia dune, nestled within the Erg Chebbi sand sea in southeastern Morocco. Rising 100 meters tall and stretching 700 meters wide with sprawling arms, Lala Lallia holds a history dating back 13,000 years, as unveiled by the meticulous study. cs, a phenomenon that reshapes landscapes over millennia. Understanding the age of these formations provides invaluable insights into the climatic conditions and wind patterns of eras long past, shedding light on Earth's dynamic history. Utilizing a sophisticated technique known as luminescence dating, researchers analyzed sand samples from the heart of Morocco's desert. By measuring the last exposure of sand grains to daylight, scientists discerned the age of Lala Lallia and uncovered its remarkable journey through time. Prof. Duller likens the mineral grains within the sand to ""little rechargeable batteries,"" storing energy derived from natural radioactivity. This stored energy, when released in the form of light in the laboratory, offers a glimpse into the dune's age and evolution. The revelation of Lala Lallia's age marks a pivotal moment in our understanding of Earth's geological tapestry. Star dunes, previously overlooked in the annals of geological history due to their sheer magnitude, now emerge as key players in unraveling Earth's past climates and landscapes. Beyond Morocco, other exemplars of these monumental dunes dot the globe, including the towering Star Dune in Colorado, USA. Prof. Duller, recounting the arduous climb up these sand behemoths, speaks of the breathtaking vistas awaiting atop, a testament to nature's grandeur."

"400","International","Netanyahu tentatively approves ceasefire with Hezbollah","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324589-netanyahu-tentatively-approves-ceasefire-with-hezbollah","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tentatively approved a proposed ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah during a security meeting with Israeli officials on Sunday night, according to a source familiar with the discussions. However, Israel reportedly has reservations about certain aspects of the deal, which are expected to be communicated to the Lebanese government on Monday. While negotiations continue, the agreement remains provisional until all outstanding issues are addressed. The Israeli cabinet's approval will also be required for the ceasefire to move forward. Sources involved in the talks expressed optimism about the progress but warned that ongoing exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah could derail the negotiations with a single misstep. US envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been mediating the discussions, stated during his visit to Beirut last week that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Lebanon was “within our grasp”, though it ultimately depends on “the decision of the parties"". He held meetings with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who serves as Hezbollah’s point of contact in the negotiations. Hochstein described the talks as “constructive” and “very good discussions to narrow the gaps"". “We have a real opportunity to bring conflict to an end,” Hochstein said last week. “The window is now.” He later traveled to Israel to finalize the negotiations. The US-backed proposal seeks a 60-day cessation of hostilities, which could serve as a foundation for a lasting ceasefire. On Sunday, Axios journalist Barak Ravid reported that Hochstein warned the Israeli ambassador to Washington that he would withdraw from mediating if Israel failed to respond positively to the proposal in the coming days. Lebanon had previously responded favourably to the U.S.-backed plan, with Prime Minister Mikati confirming that most aspects of the draft agreement had been resolved. The conflict escalated in mid-September when Israel launched a significant military offensive in Lebanon following months of cross-border skirmishes that began on October 8 of the previous year. The clashes were triggered by Hezbollah's attack on Israeli-controlled territory in support of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. Israel’s military campaign has included a ground invasion, the killing of key Hezbollah figures – including founding member Hassan Nasrallah – and attacks causing widespread destruction and thousands of injuries."

The Israeli air raids continued relentlessly, with at least seven people killed when a residential home was struck in Gaza City's Zeitoun suburb overnight. Further casualties were reported across central and southern Gaza, as the death toll rose from the ongoing attacks. One of the most devastating attacks occurred in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, where the al-Faruq Mosque was severely damaged. A social media video verified by Al Jazeera showed the extent of the damage, adding to the growing list of cultural and civilian infrastructure destroyed in the ongoing conflict. Israeli forces also intensified their ground offensive in northern Gaza, where they targeted one of the last remaining partially functional hospitals, Kamal Adwan Hospital, leading to the wounding of several healthcare workers. Hussam Abu Safia, the hospital’s director, described the attack, saying Israeli forces ""directly targeted the entrance to the emergency and reception areas, as well as the hospital courtyards, electrical generators, and gates."" This assault resulted in 12 injuries among doctors, nurses, and administrative staff. The Israeli military has denied targeting the hospital, stating that it was not aware of any strike in the area following an initial review. However, the attack has raised concerns about the safety of medical facilities, with Gaza’s Ministry of Health warning that hospitals may soon face severe restrictions on services due to limited fuel supplies. According to the Ministry, fuel reserves are expected to last only another two days. Since October 2023, Israel's military campaign against Gaza has resulted in more than 44,000 deaths and left over 104,000 people injured. The operation began following a series of deadly Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on October 7, which left at least 1,139 Israelis dead and around 250 others taken hostage. Humanitarian organizations have raised alarms over the worsening situation in Gaza, particularly in northern parts of the enclave, where supplies of food, water, and medical aid have been nearly cut off. The United Nations has warned that a famine could soon take hold in the region if conditions do not improve. On Saturday, United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin urged Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to take ""steps to improve the dire humanitarian condition in Gaza"" during a phone call, as international pressure grows for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the region."
"405","International","$300bn climate deal slammed by developing countries at COP29","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324502-300bn-climate-deal-slammed-by-developing-countries-at-cop29","A $300 billion annual climate finance target agreed upon at the COP29 summit in Azerbaijan has been deemed inadequate by many developing nations, escalating tensions between wealthier and poorer countries. Delegates from small island states and least developed nations staged a walkout from the United Nations climate talks on Saturday, citing dissatisfaction with the proposed funding package. The deal, finalised a day after the summit was set to conclude, commits richer countries to mobilize at least $300 billion annually by 2035. This amount aims to assist developing nations in transitioning to cleaner energy systems and mitigating the impacts of climate-induced disasters.However, the sum falls significantly short of the $1.3 trillion demand by the Group of 134 developing nations, which argued that the pledged amount is grossly insufficient to address their needs. Leena Nandan, India’s representative, criticized the agreement as “an illusion.” “This paltry sum does not reflect the gravity of the crisis. The document offers little more than empty promises,” she said. Discontent and walkout Tensions came to a head when representatives from small island states, particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, and the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group exited negotiations, accusing richer nations of neglecting their concerns. “We walked out because we weren’t heard,” said Cedric Schuster, the Samoan chair of the Alliance of Small Island States. Echoing his sentiments, Evans Njewa, chair of the LDC group, called the current deal “unacceptable.” Colombia’s Environment Minister, Susana Mohamed, labelled the action a sign of widespread dissatisfaction. “We came here seeking a fair deal but are leaving disappointed,” she said. Accusations against wealthy nations Developing countries accused wealthier counterparts of employing delaying tactics to exhaust their negotiators. Panama’s chief negotiator, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, expressed frustration at the repeated pattern. “They push us until we are too weak to push back. It’s a deliberate strategy,” he remarked. Rich nations, led by the US and EU, defended the agreement, citing economic constraints stemming from global conflicts and economic instability. US climate envoy John Podesta faced protests from climate activists accusing his country of shirking its responsibilities. Host country Azerbaijan urged delegations to find common ground as talks extended into the weekend. COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev emphasized the need to bridge divides, warning that a lack of consensus would damage global climate efforts. Despite these calls, smaller nations argued their concerns were overlooked. Critics also accused the presidency of prioritizing wealthier nations during negotiations. The $300 billion commitment is an increase from the previous $100 billion annual target set in Paris in 2015. However, much of the $1.3 trillion goal outlined in the COP29 agreement relies on private sector contributions, leaving many vulnerable nations questioning the reliability of these funds. Nazanine Moshiri, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, highlighted the disparity between wealthy and developing nations’ priorities. “While wealthy nations grapple with domestic financial constraints and geopolitical conflicts, developing countries face mounting losses from climate-induced disasters,” she noted."

The commemorations, held on Saturday, featured a military ceremony in central Strasbourg at Broglie Square, where Macron paid tribute to General Philippe Leclerc, who led Free French forces into the city on November 23, 1944. Macron, accompanied by a crowd that included veterans, also acknowledged the fate of the region’s many conscripts, some of whom were forced to serve in the German army during the war. Roger Le Neures, a 101-year-old veteran of the liberation, recalled the historic moment when the French flag was raised on Strasbourg's cathedral, marking the triumph of freedom over Nazi oppression. ""When we knew the flag was up on the cathedral, we had reached our objective — freedom, freeing Alsace,"" Le Neures said. Macron’s remarks focused on the largely forgotten experiences of tens of thousands of Alsatian men who were forcibly enlisted into the German army during the war. These men, known as ""Malgré-nous"" (literally ""against our will""), were coerced into a fight for Germany that they did not support. Macron called for the acknowledgment of their suffering, saying, “This tragedy must be named, recognized, and taught."" The president also visited Natzweiler-Struthof, a Nazi concentration camp in the region, where thousands of inmates died or disappeared. During the ceremony in Strasbourg, Macron highlighted the brutal history of the camp and the forced conscripts’ torment, emphasizing that their tragic fate had often been misunderstood or ignored. Macron’s speech also included the announcement that the renowned scholar and Resistance fighter Marc Bloch, who was tortured and executed by the Gestapo in 1944, would be reburied in the Panthéon, the French national monument to great figures. Bloch’s contributions to history, particularly his posthumous work ""L'Etrange Defaite,"" critiquing France’s failure to prepare for war, were acknowledged by the president as part of the nation's complex WWII legacy. The announcement was met with emotional praise from Bloch’s family, with his great-granddaughter expressing deep appreciation for the honor. However, in a letter to the president, the family requested that far-right figures be excluded from participation in the ceremony, citing concerns over the political divisions surrounding the commemoration.

Holly Bowles, 19, died in a hospital in neighbouring Thailand, where she had been evacuated for emergency treatment, the Australian foreign ministry said. Her friend died on Thursday in a another Thai hospital. ""It is with broken hearts, and we are so sad to say that our beautiful girl Holly is now at peace,"" her father, Shaun Bowles, told Australia's Nine News. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia would continue efforts with Lao authorities to investigate what she described as a tragedy. ""I know tonight all Australians will be holding both families in our hearts,"" Wong said. Altogether, six tourists - two Danes, two Australians, a Briton and an American - have died after visiting Vang Vieng, an idyllic town in the Southeast Asian nation that is popular with foreign backpackers. Lao state-run news agency KPL said on Friday that authorities were gathering evidence and witness accounts following the foreigners' deaths due to suspected ""consumption of tainted alcoholic beverages"". An official statement was expected soon. Counterfeits of well-known alcohol brands and home-made spirits are a problem in Laos. Australia and Britain have warned their citizens to be cautious when consuming drinks there. The U.S. embassy in Laos issued a warning on Friday for its citizens to be on the alert for risks of methanol poisoning in consuming spirit-based drinks, advising them to buy from licensed vendors and check for signs of tampering or counterfeiting. Methanol is a toxic alcohol that is used industrially as a solvent, pesticide, and alternative fuel source, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "
"408","International","US official sounds alarm: Chinese hackers deep in critical infrastructure","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324451-us-official-sounds-alarm-chinese-hackers-deep-in-critical-infrastructure","Chinese hackers have infiltrated critical IT networks within the United States, positioning themselves for potential disruptive attacks in the event of a conflict, a senior US cybersecurity official revealed on Friday. Morgan Adamski, Executive Director of the US Cyber Command, cautioned that these cyber operations, linked to China, are part of strategic preparations to gain the upper hand during a possible confrontation with the US. Speaking at the Cyberwarcon security conference in Arlington, Virginia, Ms. Adamski described the activities as a coordinated effort to compromise vital infrastructure. She detailed how these hackers are targeting systems managing energy supplies, water controls, and even HVAC systems in server rooms to prepare for large-scale disruptions. Earlier this year, US officials had issued warnings about similar intrusions into IT networks, allegedly conducted by China-linked groups. The operations have raised fears about the potential consequences of such attacks, which could paralyze essential services during a crisis. Largest telecommunications breach On Thursday, Senator Mark Warner, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, labeled a recent hack into US telecommunications systems as the ""most severe telecom breach in American history."" The espionage campaign, dubbed “Salt Typhoon” by Microsoft, allowed hackers to access sensitive data, including call records and communications involving prominent political figures, such as the current US presidential candidates. Mr. Warner revealed that the Chinese hackers exploited outdated equipment and network vulnerabilities to penetrate systems deeply. Investigators found that the hackers were able to monitor specific calls and text messages, although encrypted communications such as those via WhatsApp or iMessage remained secure. “This breach is unprecedented,” said Mr. Warner. “It makes previous attacks like SolarWinds or Colonial Pipeline pale in comparison.” Global countermeasures In response, US agencies have initiated “globally synchronized activities” aimed at disrupting and degrading Chinese cyber operations, Ms. Adamski stated. These measures include exposing malicious activities, issuing sanctions, and pursuing law-enforcement actions with the help of international allies. The FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are also providing technical assistance to organizations that may be targeted, urging them to enhance cybersecurity measures. Beijing denies allegations The Chinese government has consistently denied accusations of cyberattacks on US entities. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment on the latest developments. However, Mr. Warner stressed the urgent need to address the vulnerabilities that allowed such an extensive breach. “We’ve not yet discovered the full extent of the intrusion, and the threat remains active,” he warned, emphasizing the importance of stricter cybersecurity standards in the US, similar to those recently adopted in Australia and Britain."

The device’s unreliable connection underscored the broader challenges millions of students face as toxic air forces yet another round of school closures. Nearly two million students in Delhi and its surrounding areas have been ordered to stay home as worsening air pollution reaches hazardous levels. Authorities have resorted to annual shutdowns during the peak smog season, ostensibly to protect children’s health. While the measure aims to reduce exposure, it disproportionately impacts children from low-income families like Gautam's. Her parents, a roadside food stall worker and a domestic helper, cannot afford air purifiers or stay home to supervise her learning. The free lunch program at her government-run school—a vital source of nutrition—has also been disrupted. “I like going to school and playing outside,” Gautam said, expressing frustration with the confinement. Her mother, Maya Devi, lamented the situation. “Why should our children suffer? They must find a solution,” she said, adding that online lessons were no substitute for classroom education. Delhi consistently ranks as the world’s most polluted city, with PM2.5 levels—dangerous microscopic particles linked to cancer—recently recorded at 60 times the World Health Organization's recommended daily limit. Smog blankets the city every winter, driven by agricultural burning, industrial emissions, and vehicle fumes. The crisis has profound implications for children’s health. Studies have shown that exposure to polluted air increases the risk of acute respiratory infections and chronic conditions like asthma. A 2021 report revealed that nearly one-third of Delhi’s school-aged children suffer from respiratory issues. “The abrupt closures create significant disruptions,” said Sunita Bhasin, director of the Swami Sivananda Memorial Institute school. “Children are breathing the same toxic air, whether at home or on the streets. They need solutions beyond shutting schools.” Despite partial restrictions on vehicle use and measures like spraying water to suppress particulate matter, government initiatives have failed to curb Delhi’s worsening air quality.

The amendment, passed unanimously by loyalist lawmakers Friday, extends the presidential term from five to six years and grants the co-presidents sweeping authority over legislative, judicial, and electoral bodies. A second reading in January is expected to formalize the change, solidifying the pair's dominance. Ortega, 79, and Murillo, 73, have long faced international condemnation for what critics describe as a nepotistic dictatorship. Under their rule, opposition voices have been stifled, with over 5,000 NGOs shut down and hundreds of opponents jailed since mass protests in 2018. The United Nations estimates that more than 300 people died during the unrest. The revised constitution also labels critics as ""traitors to the homeland,"" a designation allowing the regime to strip individuals of citizenship, a measure already applied to hundreds of dissidents. Ortega, who first led Nicaragua from 1985 to 1990 before returning to power in 2007, proposed the constitutional changes amid mounting US and EU sanctions over human rights abuses. The amendment will define Nicaragua as a “revolutionary socialist state,” embedding the red-and-black flag of the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) as a national symbol. Critics have warned that the reform dismantles any remaining political pluralism and institutional independence. Constitutional expert Azahalea Solis described the changes as excluding alternative political ideologies, while exiled human rights lawyer Salvador Marenco labeled it the end of the separation of powers. International reaction has been swift. Organization of American States Secretary-General Luis Almagro condemned the amendment as an “aberrant form of institutionalizing marital dictatorship” and an “aggression against the democratic rule of law.” The Geneva-based UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) also expressed grave concerns in its latest report, citing arbitrary arrests, torture, and increasing violence against Indigenous communities. Manuel Orozco of the Inter-American Dialogue suggested the amendment guarantees Murillo’s succession and secures a political future for their son, Laureano Ortega. Former Ortega ally turned critic Dora Maria Tellez, now exiled in the US, summarized the move as formalizing a ""de facto dictatorship."" "

Additional District and Session court in Ferozwala has summoned Chief Editor of Verdens Gang (VG) tabloid, its reporter Mr Wold. J. Wideroe and a Pakistani small publication that reprinted the same false story. The notices have been served by the court on the three defendants to appear before the court in Mr Zahoor’s defamation case on 17 December 20204 or action will be taken against the accused ex-parte. The notices have been served already in Norway at the anti-immigration and right-wing tabloid’s  address. The case says: “The defendants in collusion with each other have been running a malicious campaign against the plaintiff since long for his religion and race. It will not be out of place to mention here that the aforesaid VG Tabloid is known for publishing anti-Islam and anti-Pakistani content and the plaintiff has been the victim of the defendants since long as they are pressurizing and blackmailing the plaintiff as the plaintiff is suffering the propaganda of the defendants No.2&3, but now they have accedes all the limits. “That the defendants No.2&3 have been targeting the plaintiff with malicious intent for the last fifteen years by publishing defamatory articles now and then.

Umar Farooq announced defamation case in September last year after the tabloid accused that the state of Pakistan had awarded him with the Hilal-e-Pakistan for his role in Toshakhana case.

But there was a problem. Local power companies did not want to pay the prices the state company was offering, jeopardizing the deal, according to U.S. authorities. To save the deal, Adani allegedly decided to bribe local officials to persuade them to buy the electricity. That allegation is at the heart of U.S. criminal and civil charges unsealed on Wednesday against Adani, who is not currently in U.S. custody and is believed to be in India. His company, Adani Group, said the charges were ""baseless"" and that it would seek ""all possible legal recourse."" The alleged hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes promised to local Indian officials caught the attention of the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission as Adani's companies were raising funds from U.S.-based investors in several transactions starting in 2021. This account of how the alleged scheme unfolded is drawn from federal prosecutors' 54-page criminal indictment, opens new tab of Adani and seven of his associates and two parallel civil SEC complaints, opens new tab, which extensively cite electronic messages between the scheme's alleged participants. In early 2020, the Solar Energy Corporation of India awarded Adani Green Energy (ADNA.NS), opens new tab and another company, Azure Power Global (AZREF.PK), opens new tab, contracts for a 12-gigawatt solar energy project, expected to yield billions of dollars in revenue for both companies, according to the indictment. It was a major step forward for Adani Green Energy, run by Adani's nephew, Sagar Adani. Up until that point, the company had only earned roughly $50 million in its history and had yet to turn a profit, according to the SEC complaint. But the initiative soon hit roadblocks. Local state electricity distributors were reluctant to commit to buying the new solar power, expecting prices to fall in the future, according to an April 7, 2021 report, opens new tab by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank. Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO at the time discussed the delays and hinted at bribes, opens new tab on the encrypted messaging application WhatsApp, according to the SEC. When the Azure CEO wrote on Nov. 24, 2020, that the local power companies ""are being motivated,"" Sagar Adani allegedly replied, ""Yup ... but the optics are very difficult to cover. In February 2021, Sagar Adani allegedly wrote to the CEO, ""Just so you know, we have doubled the incentives to push for these acceptances."" The SEC did not name the Azure CEO as a defendant, but Azure's securities filings show the CEO at the time was Ranjit Gupta. Gupta was charged by the Justice Department with conspiracy to violate an anti-bribery law. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Azure said on Thursday it was cooperating with the U.S. investigations, and that the individuals involved with the accusations had left the company more than a year ago. 'SUDDEN GOOD FORTUNE' In August of 2021, Gautam Adani had the first of several meetings with an official in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, to whom he allegedly ultimately promised $228 million in bribes in exchange for agreeing to have the state buy the power, according to the Justice Department's indictment. By December, Andhra Pradesh had agreed to buy the power, and other states with smaller contracts soon followed. Other states' officials were promised bribes as well, U.S. authorities said. During a Dec. 6, 2021 meeting at a coffee shop, Azure executives allegedly discussed ""rumors that the Adanis had somehow facilitated signing"" of the deals, according to the SEC. Gautam Adani said, opens new tab on Dec. 14, 2021, the company was on track ""to become the world's largest renewables player by 2030."" ""The sudden good fortune for Azure and Adani Green prompted speculation in the marketplace about the contract awards,"" the SEC wrote in its complaint. LETTER FROM THE SEC Before long, the SEC began to probe. The agency sent a ""general inquiry"" letter to Azure - which at the time traded on the New York Stock Exchange - on March 17, 2022, asking about its recent contracts and if foreign officials had sought anything of value, according to the Justice Department indictment. According to the Department of Justice, Gautam Adani told representatives of Azure during a meeting in his Ahmedabad, India office the next month that he expected to be reimbursed more than $80 million for the bribes he had paid officials that ultimately benefited Azure's contracts. Some Azure representatives and a leading investor in the company decided to pay Adani back by allowing his company to take over a potentially profitable project. The representatives and investor allegedly agreed to tell Azure's board of directors that Adani had requested bribe money, but hid their role in the scheme, prosecutors said. All the while, Adani's companies were raising billions of dollars in loans and bonds through international banks, including from U.S. investors. In four separate fundraising transactions between 2021 and 2024, the companies sent investors documents indicating that they had not paid bribes - statements prosecutors say are false and constitute fraud. FBI SEARCH During a visit to the United States on March 17, 2023, FBI agents seized Sagar Adani's electronic devices. The agents handed him a search warrant from a judge indicating that the U.S. government was investigating potential violations of fraud statutes and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. According to prosecutors, Gautam Adani emailed himself photographs of each page of the search warrant on March 18, 2023. His companies nonetheless went through with a $1.36 billion syndicated loan agreement on Dec. 5, 2023, and another sale of secured notes in March 2024, and once again furnished investors with misleading information about their anti-bribery practices, according to prosecutors. On Oct. 24, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn secured a secret grand jury indictment against Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani, Gupta, and five others allegedly involved in the scheme. The indictment was unsealed on Nov. 20, prompting a $27 billion plunge in Adani Group companies' market value. Adani Green Energy promptly canceled a scheduled $600 million bond sale."

Boeing projected last year that approximately 650,000 new pilots will be required globally over the next two decades, with 58,000 needed in the Middle East alone. This translates to an annual demand of 32,500 pilots, a stark contrast to the 4,500 pilots who entered the field annually over the past 20 years. “The demand is almost seven times more than what’s available. The aviation training industry is not moving at the same pace as the rising demand,” said Capt Abhishek Nadkarni, CEO of Sharjah-based pilot training academy Pier Seven. He highlighted that pilot training is expensive and highly complex. “In the past, only 20% of trained pilots made it to airplanes; the remaining 80% don’t make it. But now airlines are recruiting people with lower calibre because there aren’t enough pilots to meet the demand.” Nadkarni emphasized the need for airlines to sponsor young talent for aviation schools, as many are hesitant to invest in costly training programs without guaranteed career prospects. Despite these challenges, Pier Seven has seen a rise in demand, having trained 500 pilots in the past three years. The academy plans to expand its operations by adding 14 flight simulators by 2026. “We train pilots who have already finished their initial pilot training on specialised aircraft.” Since its inception in 2014, it has trained over 1,500 pilots, specializing in advanced training for those who have completed their initial certification. Efforts to address this shortage are underway. At the Air Expo 2024, held at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), the Middle East Aviation Career Zone (MEAC) was introduced to connect aspiring aviation professionals with opportunities. The three-day event brings together 50 airlines, 40 training academies, hundreds of students, and is expected to draw 20,000 visitors. ""We aim to use Air Expo 2024 as a platform to inspire youth to explore all aviation roles, from ground operations to the skies,” said Didier Mary, CEO and Founder of Air Expo. He noted the aviation industry’s remarkable recovery post-COVID-19, with the global fleet now 10% larger than pre-pandemic levels. For instance, Emirates Airlines rebounded from pandemic losses within six months, significantly expanding its fleet in the past year, mirroring trends worldwide. Etihad Aviation Training (EAT) also reported a 250% increase in pilot training demand recently. “We’ve trained numerous professionals returning to the aviation sector post-pandemic,” said EAT CEO Paolo La Cava. He emphasized that aviation careers extend beyond piloting and cabin crew, offering roles in engineering and ground operations. Collaborative efforts between airlines, training institutions, and tech firms are helping the industry adapt to evolving challenges and opportunities. Abu Dhabi-based aerospace engineering company Sanad is among those offering a range of aviation jobs and training programs. Omar Al Jefri, a 29-year-old Emirati graduate of the Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT), began his career at Sanad as an intern and now works as a repair capability engineer. “I’ve always been fascinated by aerospace, even though my five brothers pursued other engineering fields. Aviation engineering is unique and demands true passion to succeed,” he shared, noting a growing interest in the sector among youth. Despite the challenges, the aviation industry presents rewarding opportunities for individuals drawn to its dynamic and evolving landscape."

In its ruling, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I dismissed Israel's objections regarding the court's authority to investigate Israeli nationals, particularly in relation to events occurring between October 8, 2023, and May 20, 2024. The chamber found that the ICC had the legal grounds to proceed with the investigation, citing the court's jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories of Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, as determined in previous rulings. The arrest warrants were issued after the court concluded that Netanyahu and Gallant bear responsibility for crimes including the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare, and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts. The charges stem from alleged actions that resulted in widespread deprivation of food, water, medicine, and essential supplies to the civilian population of Gaza, contributing to severe humanitarian conditions. The ICC noted that these acts were carried out by Israeli government bodies and military forces, which, according to the chamber, had intentionally deprived civilians in Gaza of basic survival necessities. Humanitarian organizations, it was stated, faced significant restrictions on their operations, exacerbating the suffering of civilians in the region. The arrest warrants, classified as ""secret"" to protect ongoing investigations and witnesses, highlight the ICC's determination to hold individuals accountable for their actions, even as the situation in Gaza continues to evolve. Netanyahu and Gallant, who are accused of directing these operations, are also held responsible for failing to prevent or repress crimes committed by Israeli forces under their command. Israel had previously challenged the legitimacy of the investigation, with the government claiming that the ICC lacked jurisdiction over its actions. The court, however, dismissed these challenges, stating that jurisdiction was based on the territorial scope of the conflict and the applicability of international humanitarian law. The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant are part of a broader investigation into the Israel-Palestine conflict, which has drawn international scrutiny. The situation has prompted several countries, including South Africa, Bangladesh, and Bolivia, to refer the matter to the ICC."

Bangladesh, formerly known as East Pakistan, was separated in 1971 and later Pakistan accepted it as sovereign country in 1974. The relationship between both countries have been remained tremendous but during Hasina Wazid era pro-India policies led to cornering Pakistan in the mainstream Bangladesh debate creating huge communication vacuumed between the two countries. Now, since the interim government came into power with the support of the Students revolution, the relations between the two brotherly countries are being normalized. The 2300 TAU cargo vessel, originating from Karachi, arrived at Chittagong Port a few days ago. The Pakistan High Commission in Bangladesh hailed this development, emphasizing that the new sea trade corridor would enhance the supply chain efficiency, save time, and create fresh business opportunities for both countries. The President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Javed Balwani, expressed optimism about the restoration of sea trade, particularly for the textile and garment sectors. “This is a golden opportunity for Pakistani exporters to introduce their products in the Bangladeshi market. Increased exports will positively impact our foreign exchange reserves,” said Balwani. Previously, trade between Pakistan and Bangladesh relied on indirect routes via Sri Lanka or Dubai, and air connectivity between the two nations had been suspended since 2018. Economists predict that reopening this sea corridor could significantly boost trade volumes in the coming years, marking a turning point in bilateral economic relations. "

U.S authorities said Adani and seven other defendants, including his nephew Sagar Adani, agreed to pay the bribes to Indian government officials to obtain contracts expected to yield $2 billion of profit over 20 years, and develop India's largest solar power plant project. A judge has issued arrest warrants for Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani and prosecutors plan to hand those warrants to foreign law enforcement, court records show. Prosecutors also said the Adanis and another executive at Adani Green Energy, former CEO Vneet Jaain, raised more than $3 billion in loans and bonds by hiding their corruption from lenders and investors. Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Jaain were charged with securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, and the Adanis were also charged in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case. Fallout for the Adani empire, which was rocked by a short-seller attack in February 2023, was immediate with shares in conglomerate's listed companies stocks tumbling between 10% and 20%. Adani Green Energy also cancelled plans on Thursday to raise $600 million in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. The bond had been priced but was pulled following the news. Adani dollar bonds slumped in Asian trading, with prices down between 3-5c on bonds for Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone . The falls were the largest since the Adani Group came under a short-seller attack in February 2023. According to an indictment, some conspirators referred privately to Gautam Adani with the code names ""Numero uno"" and ""the big man,"" while Sagar Adani allegedly used his cellphone to track specifics about the bribes. The Adani Group has not responded to requests for comment. Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Jaain were charged with securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, and the Adanis were also charged in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case. Five other defendants were charged with conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. anti-bribery law, and four were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice. None of the defendants is in custody, a spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Breon Peace in Brooklyn said. Gautam Adani is believed to be in India. Shares in GQG Partners , an Australia-listed investment firm that is a major Adani backer, slid 20%. The decline was the stock's largest one-day fall since it listed three years ago. GQG last year bought 3.4% of Adani Enterprises - the group's flagship firm, 4.1% of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, 2.5% of Adani Transmission and 3.5% of Adani Green Energy. It said in a statement that it was monitoring the charges. Gautam Adani, 62, is worth $69.8 billion according to Forbes magazine.

U.S. President-elect Trump, who has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, is returning to the White House at a time of Russian ascendancy. Moscow controls a chunk of Ukraine about the size of the American state of Virginia and is advancing at the fastest pace since the early days of the 2022 invasion. In the first detailed reporting of what President Putin would accept in any deal brokered by Trump, the five current and former Russian officials said the Kremlin could broadly agree to freeze the conflict along the front lines. There may be room for negotiation over the precise carve-up of the four eastern regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, according to three of the people who all requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. While Moscow claims the four regions as wholly part of Russia, defended by the country's nuclear umbrella, its forces on the ground control 70-80% of the territory with about 26,000 square km still held by Ukrainian troops, open-source data on the front line shows. Russia may also be open to withdrawing from the relatively small patches of territory it holds in the Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions, in the north and south of Ukraine, two of the officials said. Putin said this month that any ceasefire deal should reflect the ""realities"" on the ground but that he feared a short-lived truce which would only allow the West to rearm Ukraine. ""If there is no neutrality, it is difficult to imagine the existence of any good-neighbourly relations between Russia and Ukraine,"" Putin told the Valdai discussion group on Nov. 7. ""Why? Because this would mean that Ukraine will be constantly used as a tool in the wrong hands and to the detriment of the interests of the Russian Federation."" Two of the sources said outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to fire American ATACMS missiles deep into Russia could complicate and delay any settlement - and stiffen Moscow's demands as hardliners push for a bigger chunk of Ukraine. On Tuesday, Kyiv used the missiles to strike Russian territory for the first time, according to Moscow which decried the move as a major escalation. If no ceasefire is agreed, the two sources said, then Russia will fight on. ""Putin has already said that freezing the conflict will not work in any way,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters hours before the Russians reported the ATACMS strikes. ""And the missile authorisation is a very dangerous escalation on the part of the United States."" The Ukrainian foreign ministry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment for this article. Trump's communications director Steven Cheung told Reuters about the incoming U.S. president: ""He is the only person who can bring both sides together in order to negotiate peace, and work towards ending the war and stopping the killing."" Real estate billionaire Trump, author of the 1987 book ""Trump: the Art of the Deal"", has said he would speak directly to Putin in his efforts to forge a peace deal, though has given no details on how he might reconcile the warring sides, which both show scant sign of backing down. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said his country will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from its territory - based on the borders it gained after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union - though top U.S. generals have said publicly that this is a very ambitious aim. On June 14, Putin set out his opening terms for an immediate end to the war, opens new tab: Ukraine must drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw all of its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia. SECURITY GUARANTEES, ARMY LIMITS While Russia will not tolerate Ukraine joining NATO, or the presence of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil, it is open to discussing security guarantees for Kyiv, according to the five current and former officials. Other Ukrainian concessions the Kremlin could push for include Kyiv agreeing to limit the size of its armed forces and committing not to restrict the use of the Russian language, the people said. Dimitri Simes, who emigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1973 and is one of Russia's best-connected experts on America, said a ceasefire agreement could be struck relatively swiftly to end the war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers and displaced millions of civilians. But a wider, lasting deal that addressed both Ukraine and Russia's security concerns would be extremely challenging to forge, he added. ""A grand bargain, in my view, would be very difficult to reach as the positions of the two sides are very far apart."" 'HARSH TRUTH: RUSSIA IS WINNING' Russia controls 18% of Ukraine including all of Crimea, a peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, 80% of the Donbas - the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - and more than 70% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. It also holds just under 3% of the Kharkiv region and a sliver of Mykolaiv. In total, Russia has over 110,000 square km of Ukrainian territory. Ukraine holds about 650 square km of Russia's Kursk region. Domestically, Putin could sell a ceasefire deal that saw Russia hold onto most of the territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson as a victory that ensured the defence of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine and safeguarded the landbridge to Crimea, according to one of the sources. The future of Crimea itself is not up for discussion, all the Russian officials said. One of the officials, a senior source with knowledge of top-level Kremlin discussions, said the West would have to accept the ""harsh truth"" that all the support it had given Ukraine could not prevent Russia from winning the war. Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who watched the Soviet Union crumble while stationed in Dresden, took the decision to invade Ukraine himself with only limited counsel from a tiny group of trusted advisers, 10 Russian sources with knowledge of Kremlin thinking told Reuters. He will likewise have the deciding voice on any ceasefire, according to the five current and former officials. The Kremlin chief presents what he calls the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine as a watershed moment when Moscow finally stood up to what he sees as the arrogance of the West which enlarged NATO eastwards towards Russia's borders and meddled in the politics of what Moscow considers as its own backyard, including Georgia and, crucially, Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say the invasion was an attempt to grab sovereign Ukrainian territory. When asked what a possible ceasefire might look like, two of the Russian sources referred to a draft agreement that was almost approved in April 2022 after talks in Istanbul, and which Putin has referred to in public as a possible basis for a deal. Under that draft, opens new tab, a copy of which Reuters has seen, Ukraine should agree to permanent neutrality in return for international security guarantees from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. One of the Russian officials said there would be no agreement unless Ukraine received security guarantees, adding: ""The question is how to avoid a deal that locks the West into a possible direct confrontation with Russia one day."""

The accord, which led to U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, has faced significant implementation challenges with reported violations by the Taliban regime. Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio has called for designating the Taliban as a ""terrorist organization,"" highlighting concerns over Afghanistan's territory being used as a safe haven for terrorist groups. Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken had previously cited ""serious violations"" of the agreement, particularly regarding Al-Qaeda's presence. United Nations reports indicate the presence of 6,000-6,500 TTP fighters in Afghanistan, with recent intelligence suggesting increased operational support from Al-Qaeda networks. Defense analysts emphasize this poses a significant threat to regional stability. On the humanitarian front, UNICEF reports over 4 million children are out of school, while UNESCO documents that 2.5 million girls have been denied education under Taliban rule. The Center for Information Resilience has recorded 332 cases of violence against women. While Zalmay Khalilzad expresses optimism about full implementation of the Doha Agreement under Trump's presidency, security experts emphasize that addressing terrorism and restoring human rights will likely be primary challenges for the incoming U.S. administration."

McMahon, who served as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) during Trump's first term, was chosen due to her ""decades of leadership experience"" and her deep understanding of business, according to Trump’s statement on Truth Social. Trump emphasised that McMahon would work to ""empower the next generation of American students and workers,"" leveraging her broad business acumen to reform the education system. McMahon, 75, has been a major supporter of Trump, donating millions to his campaigns and serving as co-chair for his transition team after the 2020 election. Her nomination, however, has sparked questions due to her limited background in education policy. While McMahon served on the Connecticut state board of education from 2009 to 2010, her experience in educational leadership is far outweighed by her extensive tenure in the business world. McMahon co-founded WWE in 1980 with her husband, Vince McMahon, and remained at the helm until 2009. She stepped down from her role at WWE to focus on her Senate run, which ended unsuccessfully in 2010. Despite these concerns, Trump’s announcement follows a familiar pattern in his cabinet appointments, which have largely prioritized loyalists with personal and political ties over traditional qualifications. McMahon is also the chair of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank that champions conservative policies aligned with Trump’s ideology, further bolstering her chances for Senate confirmation. In his statement, Trump touted McMahon’s advocacy for ""Parents’ Rights"" and emphasized her goal of ""sending education BACK TO THE STATES,"" aligning with his long-standing promise to abolish the Department of Education. McMahon’s nomination will likely face scrutiny in the Senate, but with Republicans holding a majority, her confirmation seems all but assured. Alongside McMahon’s nomination, Trump also selected Mehmet Oz, a celebrity doctor and former television host, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Oz, known for his appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show and his own talk show The Dr. Oz Show, has faced significant criticism throughout his career for promoting unproven medical treatments and controversial health advice. Despite this, Trump called Oz “one of the most qualified” individuals to reform the nation's healthcare system, particularly its large-scale government-run programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Oz, who trained as a cardiothoracic surgeon, was widely criticized during the COVID-19 pandemic for promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the virus, a stance that has since been debunked by health experts. Additionally, his public endorsement of alternative medicine and weight loss products has earned him widespread criticism in medical circles. In his statement, Trump lauded Oz for his potential to “cut waste and fraud” within CMS, a vital agency that oversees the healthcare of millions of Americans. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates health insurance and determines the reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals, plays a key role in the U.S. healthcare system. With government spending on these programs reaching over $1.4 trillion in 2023, Trump’s goal of reducing inefficiencies and expanding access to healthcare could face significant challenges."

According to Muqeem's testimony, the violence began on March 25, 1971, when Bengali separatists aligned with Mukti Bahini and Indian forces initiated operations against the Bihari population. The attacks resulted in the elimination of Bihari residents from 14 out of 17 districts in East Pakistan. Muqeem revealed that approximately 550,000 Biharis were killed during the conflict. He identified several key locations including Kunjan River, Bogra, Mymensingh, Dhaka, Rajshahi, and Pabna as sites of significant violence against the community. In his account, Muqeem described coordinated attacks on Bihari settlements and properties by combined forces of Mukti Bahini, Indian military, and Bengali separatists.

After nearly three hours of vote counting, the NDA in Maharashtra is securing a decisive mandate, outpacing the opposition. Exit polls had predicted a tight race, but the trends indicate a clear win for the NDA coalition, which includes the BJP, Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Deputy CM Ajit Pawar. The Mahayuti alliance, which the BJP leads, contested 148 seats, followed by Shiv Sena with 80 and NCP with 52 seats. The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is trailing, with Congress, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Bal Thackeray), and NCP (Sharad Pawar) fielding 102, 96, and 86 seats respectively. The election is particularly significant as it marks the first contest since the splits in both the NCP and Shiv Sena, following political upheavals in 2022. The results will have a lasting impact on the future of these parties, especially with leaders like Uddhav Thackeray and Eknath Shinde competing for the legacy of Balasaheb Thackeray. The NCP's internal division also adds weight to this election, with Ajit Pawar now part of the ruling coalition. In Jharkhand, early trends suggest a tough battle between the ruling JMM-led alliance and the NDA. The JMM-led government, headed by Chief Minister Hemant Soren, is banking on its achievements, while the NDA, led by the BJP, is targeting the state's governance issues, including tribal rights and infiltration concerns.

But there was a problem. Local power companies did not want to pay the prices the state company was offering, jeopardizing the deal, according to U.S. authorities. To save the deal, Adani allegedly decided to bribe local officials to persuade them to buy the electricity. That allegation is at the heart of U.S. criminal and civil charges unsealed on Wednesday against Adani, who is not currently in U.S. custody and is believed to be in India. His company, Adani Group, said the charges were ""baseless"" and that it would seek ""all possible legal recourse."" The alleged hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes promised to local Indian officials caught the attention of the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission as Adani's companies were raising funds from U.S.-based investors in several transactions starting in 2021.

According to the Department of Justice, Gautam Adani told representatives of Azure during a meeting in his Ahmedabad, India office the next month that he expected to be reimbursed more than $80 million for the bribes he had paid officials that ultimately benefited Azure's contracts. Some Azure representatives and a leading investor in the company decided to pay Adani back by allowing his company to take over a potentially profitable project. The representatives and investor allegedly agreed to tell Azure's board of directors that Adani had requested bribe money, but hid their role in the scheme, prosecutors said. All the while, Adani's companies were raising billions of dollars in loans and bonds through international banks, including from U.S. investors. In four separate fundraising transactions between 2021 and 2024, the companies sent investors documents indicating that they had not paid bribes - statements prosecutors say are false and constitute fraud. FBI SEARCH During a visit to the United States on March 17, 2023, FBI agents seized Sagar Adani's electronic devices. The agents handed him a search warrant from a judge indicating that the U.S. government was investigating potential violations of fraud statutes and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. According to prosecutors, Gautam Adani emailed himself photographs of each page of the search warrant on March 18, 2023. His companies nonetheless went through with a $1.36 billion syndicated loan agreement on Dec. 5, 2023, and another sale of secured notes in March 2024, and once again furnished investors with misleading information about their anti-bribery practices, according to prosecutors. On Oct. 24, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn secured a secret grand jury indictment against Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani, Gupta, and five others allegedly involved in the scheme. The indictment was unsealed on Nov. 20, prompting a $27 billion plunge in Adani Group companies' market value. Adani Green Energy promptly canceled a scheduled $600 million bond sale."

The accord, which led to U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, has faced significant implementation challenges with reported violations by the Taliban regime. Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio has called for designating the Taliban as a ""terrorist organization,"" highlighting concerns over Afghanistan's territory being used as a safe haven for terrorist groups. Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken had previously cited ""serious violations"" of the agreement, particularly regarding Al-Qaeda's presence. United Nations reports indicate the presence of 6,000-6,500 TTP fighters in Afghanistan, with recent intelligence suggesting increased operational support from Al-Qaeda networks. Defense analysts emphasize this poses a significant threat to regional stability. On the humanitarian front, UNICEF reports over 4 million children are out of school, while UNESCO documents that 2.5 million girls have been denied education under Taliban rule. The Center for Information Resilience has recorded 332 cases of violence against women. While Zalmay Khalilzad expresses optimism about full implementation of the Doha Agreement under Trump's presidency, security experts emphasize that addressing terrorism and restoring human rights will likely be primary challenges for the incoming U.S. administration."

The directive represents a significant shift in the Taliban's internal security management. The order effectively limits the authority of Defense Minister Yaqoob and Interior Minister Haqqani over military assets, establishing a more centralized command structure. This development comes amid concerns about weapons flowing through eastern Afghanistan's unchecked channels. The mandate appears to be triggered by regional security concerns, particularly regarding the potential misuse of abandoned US military equipment. Akhundzada's directive emphasizes strengthening internal security measures and preventing military resources from becoming cross-border security threats. The decree not only reinforces Akhundzada's control over military assets but also demonstrates the Taliban leadership's response to regional stability concerns. This centralization effort suggests an attempt to implement stricter oversight of military resources."

The COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan's capital Baku will be among the highest-profile multilateral events attended by Taliban administration officials since they took control in Kabul after 20 years of fighting NATO-backed forces. The U.N. has not allowed the Taliban to take up Afghanistan's seat at the General Assembly, and Afghanistan's government is not formally recognised by U.N. member states, largely due to the Taliban's restrictions on women's education and freedom of movement. Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said officials from the National Environmental Protection Agency had arrived in Azerbaijan to attend the COP conference. The Taliban took over the agency when they returned to power as U.S.-led forces withdrew. Taliban officials have taken part in U.N.-organised meetings on Afghanistan in Doha, and Taliban ministers have attended forums in China and Central Asia in the past two years. But the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Bureau of the COP has deferred consideration of Afghanistan’s participation since 2021, in effect freezing the country out of the talks. Afghan NGOs have also struggled to attend the climate negotiations in recent years. Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to ""potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,"" a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Because the Taliban are not formally recognised within the U.N. system as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, the source said, the officials cannot receive credentials to take part in the proceedings of full member states."

Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch addressed the media, reiterating the government's stance against such targeted violence, particularly against representatives of the Pakistani High Commission. The attack occurred shortly after a ceremony at Middle Temple, a prominent legal institution in the UK, where Qazi Faiz Isa was honored and elected as a bencher. During the event, a group of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters protested outside, leading to the attack on his vehicle as he departed. Baloch emphasized that the Interior Minister had provided a comprehensive statement regarding the incident and affirmed the government's commitment to ensuring justice for the attack on Qazi Faiz Isa and the High Commission's vehicle. During the briefing, the spokesperson also addressed several international issues, including Pakistan's desire to join BRICS and its call for peace in Palestine and Lebanon, urging the international community to hold Israel accountable for alleged war crimes. Baloch reaffirmed Pakistan's ongoing support for a resolution to the Kashmir issue based on the wishes of the Kashmiri people. She announced Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's two-day visit to Doha, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, following his participation in an investment summit in Riyadh, where he met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. On the matter of domestic security, Baloch stated that Pakistan has no intention of negotiating with terrorist groups, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and urged the Afghan government to take action against all banned groups. She also assured that Pakistan is committed to the safety of Chinese residents and companies following recent incidents involving them in Pakistan."

The initiative, part of a comprehensive three-year security enhancement plan, aims to strengthen border control and combat potential terrorist activities along the Iranian-Afghan frontier. Iranian security officials confirmed that active security measures have already been implemented along the border zone, with the wall construction representing the latest phase in their border protection strategy. The project demonstrates Iran's commitment to maintaining its territorial sovereignty and addressing regional instability. Security experts note that this infrastructure development will serve as a physical deterrent against cross-border threats. Iranian authorities emphasize that the wall is a necessary response to evolving security challenges in the region. The construction project includes modern surveillance systems and enhanced monitoring capabilities. Defense analysts suggest that this security infrastructure will play a crucial role in preventing unauthorized border crossings and illegal activities along the frontier. The border wall project reflects Iran's broader national security strategy, aimed at strengthening its eastern boundaries and ensuring regional stability. Officials state that the initiative will help maintain peace while protecting national interests. Local authorities have begun implementing preliminary security measures, with construction activities scheduled to progress in phases over the three-year period."
"435","International","Netanyahu tentatively approves ceasefire with Hezbollah","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324589-netanyahu-tentatively-approves-ceasefire-with-hezbollah","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tentatively approved a proposed ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah during a security meeting with Israeli officials on Sunday night, according to a source familiar with the discussions. However, Israel reportedly has reservations about certain aspects of the deal, which are expected to be communicated to the Lebanese government on Monday. While negotiations continue, the agreement remains provisional until all outstanding issues are addressed. The Israeli cabinet's approval will also be required for the ceasefire to move forward. Sources involved in the talks expressed optimism about the progress but warned that ongoing exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah could derail the negotiations with a single misstep. US envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been mediating the discussions, stated during his visit to Beirut last week that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Lebanon was “within our grasp”, though it ultimately depends on “the decision of the parties"". He held meetings with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who serves as Hezbollah’s point of contact in the negotiations. Hochstein described the talks as “constructive” and “very good discussions to narrow the gaps"". “We have a real opportunity to bring conflict to an end,” Hochstein said last week. “The window is now.” He later traveled to Israel to finalize the negotiations. The US-backed proposal seeks a 60-day cessation of hostilities, which could serve as a foundation for a lasting ceasefire. On Sunday, Axios journalist Barak Ravid reported that Hochstein warned the Israeli ambassador to Washington that he would withdraw from mediating if Israel failed to respond positively to the proposal in the coming days. Lebanon had previously responded favourably to the U.S.-backed plan, with Prime Minister Mikati confirming that most aspects of the draft agreement had been resolved. The conflict escalated in mid-September when Israel launched a significant military offensive in Lebanon following months of cross-border skirmishes that began on October 8 of the previous year. The clashes were triggered by Hezbollah's attack on Israeli-controlled territory in support of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. Israel’s military campaign has included a ground invasion, the killing of key Hezbollah figures – including founding member Hassan Nasrallah – and attacks causing widespread destruction and thousands of injuries."
"436","International","UAE offers thousands of jobs, training opportunities","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324378-uae-offers-thousands-of-jobs-training-opportunities","With travel and tourism booming over the past three years, the UAE's aviation industry is grappling with a pilot shortage, forcing some airlines to compromise on quality to address the gap. Boeing projected last year that approximately 650,000 new pilots will be required globally over the next two decades, with 58,000 needed in the Middle East alone. This translates to an annual demand of 32,500 pilots, a stark contrast to the 4,500 pilots who entered the field annually over the past 20 years. “The demand is almost seven times more than what’s available. The aviation training industry is not moving at the same pace as the rising demand,” said Capt Abhishek Nadkarni, CEO of Sharjah-based pilot training academy Pier Seven. He highlighted that pilot training is expensive and highly complex. “In the past, only 20% of trained pilots made it to airplanes; the remaining 80% don’t make it. But now airlines are recruiting people with lower calibre because there aren’t enough pilots to meet the demand.” Nadkarni emphasized the need for airlines to sponsor young talent for aviation schools, as many are hesitant to invest in costly training programs without guaranteed career prospects. Despite these challenges, Pier Seven has seen a rise in demand, having trained 500 pilots in the past three years. The academy plans to expand its operations by adding 14 flight simulators by 2026. “We train pilots who have already finished their initial pilot training on specialised aircraft.” Since its inception in 2014, it has trained over 1,500 pilots, specializing in advanced training for those who have completed their initial certification. Efforts to address this shortage are underway. At the Air Expo 2024, held at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), the Middle East Aviation Career Zone (MEAC) was introduced to connect aspiring aviation professionals with opportunities. The three-day event brings together 50 airlines, 40 training academies, hundreds of students, and is expected to draw 20,000 visitors. ""We aim to use Air Expo 2024 as a platform to inspire youth to explore all aviation roles, from ground operations to the skies,” said Didier Mary, CEO and Founder of Air Expo. He noted the aviation industry’s remarkable recovery post-COVID-19, with the global fleet now 10% larger than pre-pandemic levels. For instance, Emirates Airlines rebounded from pandemic losses within six months, significantly expanding its fleet in the past year, mirroring trends worldwide. Etihad Aviation Training (EAT) also reported a 250% increase in pilot training demand recently. “We’ve trained numerous professionals returning to the aviation sector post-pandemic,” said EAT CEO Paolo La Cava. He emphasized that aviation careers extend beyond piloting and cabin crew, offering roles in engineering and ground operations. Collaborative efforts between airlines, training institutions, and tech firms are helping the industry adapt to evolving challenges and opportunities. Abu Dhabi-based aerospace engineering company Sanad is among those offering a range of aviation jobs and training programs. Omar Al Jefri, a 29-year-old Emirati graduate of the Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT), began his career at Sanad as an intern and now works as a repair capability engineer. “I’ve always been fascinated by aerospace, even though my five brothers pursued other engineering fields. Aviation engineering is unique and demands true passion to succeed,” he shared, noting a growing interest in the sector among youth. Despite the challenges, the aviation industry presents rewarding opportunities for individuals drawn to its dynamic and evolving landscape."

Araqchi also warned that Iran was ""prepared for confrontation or cooperation"" in its dispute with the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA and Western countries within the body over its nuclear programme. ""This (reported meeting) was a fabricated story by American media, and the motives behind this can also be speculated,"" Araqchi said, reiterating an earlier denial by Iran's Foreign Ministry. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Musk, who is an adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, met with Iran's ambassador to the United Nations on Monday. ""In my opinion, the American media’s fabrication about a meeting between Elon Musk and Iran’s representative is a form of testing the waters to see if the ground for such move exists,"" Araqchi said. ""We are still waiting for the new U.S. administration to clarify its policies, and based on that, we will adjust our own policies. Right now, it is neither the time for such meetings nor is it appropriate,"" Araqchi said. ""There was no permission from the leadership for such a meeting,"" Araqchi said, referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters of state. Relations between Tehran and the IAEA have soured over several long-standing issues, including Iran barring the agency's uranium-enrichment experts from the country and its failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. ""Our nuclear path in the coming year will be sensitive and complex, and we are prepared for confrontation or cooperation,"" Araqchi said. He said that the 2015 nuclear deal, from which Trump exited in 2018 in his first term, no longer holds the same value for Iran. ""If negotiations begin, the nuclear pact may serve as a reference, but it no longer has its previous significance. We must reach a feasible agreement,"" Araqchi said."

U.S. President-elect Trump, who has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, is returning to the White House at a time of Russian ascendancy. Moscow controls a chunk of Ukraine about the size of the American state of Virginia and is advancing at the fastest pace since the early days of the 2022 invasion. In the first detailed reporting of what President Putin would accept in any deal brokered by Trump, the five current and former Russian officials said the Kremlin could broadly agree to freeze the conflict along the front lines. There may be room for negotiation over the precise carve-up of the four eastern regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, according to three of the people who all requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. While Moscow claims the four regions as wholly part of Russia, defended by the country's nuclear umbrella, its forces on the ground control 70-80% of the territory with about 26,000 square km still held by Ukrainian troops, open-source data on the front line shows. Russia may also be open to withdrawing from the relatively small patches of territory it holds in the Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions, in the north and south of Ukraine, two of the officials said. Putin said this month that any ceasefire deal should reflect the ""realities"" on the ground but that he feared a short-lived truce which would only allow the West to rearm Ukraine. ""If there is no neutrality, it is difficult to imagine the existence of any good-neighbourly relations between Russia and Ukraine,"" Putin told the Valdai discussion group on Nov. 7. ""Why? Because this would mean that Ukraine will be constantly used as a tool in the wrong hands and to the detriment of the interests of the Russian Federation."" Two of the sources said outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to fire American ATACMS missiles deep into Russia could complicate and delay any settlement - and stiffen Moscow's demands as hardliners push for a bigger chunk of Ukraine. On Tuesday, Kyiv used the missiles to strike Russian territory for the first time, according to Moscow which decried the move as a major escalation. If no ceasefire is agreed, the two sources said, then Russia will fight on. ""Putin has already said that freezing the conflict will not work in any way,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters hours before the Russians reported the ATACMS strikes. ""And the missile authorisation is a very dangerous escalation on the part of the United States."" The Ukrainian foreign ministry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment for this article. Trump's communications director Steven Cheung told Reuters about the incoming U.S. president: ""He is the only person who can bring both sides together in order to negotiate peace, and work towards ending the war and stopping the killing."" Real estate billionaire Trump, author of the 1987 book ""Trump: the Art of the Deal"", has said he would speak directly to Putin in his efforts to forge a peace deal, though has given no details on how he might reconcile the warring sides, which both show scant sign of backing down. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said his country will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from its territory - based on the borders it gained after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union - though top U.S. generals have said publicly that this is a very ambitious aim. On June 14, Putin set out his opening terms for an immediate end to the war, opens new tab: Ukraine must drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw all of its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia. SECURITY GUARANTEES, ARMY LIMITS While Russia will not tolerate Ukraine joining NATO, or the presence of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil, it is open to discussing security guarantees for Kyiv, according to the five current and former officials. Other Ukrainian concessions the Kremlin could push for include Kyiv agreeing to limit the size of its armed forces and committing not to restrict the use of the Russian language, the people said. Dimitri Simes, who emigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1973 and is one of Russia's best-connected experts on America, said a ceasefire agreement could be struck relatively swiftly to end the war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers and displaced millions of civilians. But a wider, lasting deal that addressed both Ukraine and Russia's security concerns would be extremely challenging to forge, he added. ""A grand bargain, in my view, would be very difficult to reach as the positions of the two sides are very far apart."" 'HARSH TRUTH: RUSSIA IS WINNING' Russia controls 18% of Ukraine including all of Crimea, a peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, 80% of the Donbas - the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - and more than 70% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. It also holds just under 3% of the Kharkiv region and a sliver of Mykolaiv. In total, Russia has over 110,000 square km of Ukrainian territory. Ukraine holds about 650 square km of Russia's Kursk region. Domestically, Putin could sell a ceasefire deal that saw Russia hold onto most of the territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson as a victory that ensured the defence of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine and safeguarded the landbridge to Crimea, according to one of the sources. The future of Crimea itself is not up for discussion, all the Russian officials said. One of the officials, a senior source with knowledge of top-level Kremlin discussions, said the West would have to accept the ""harsh truth"" that all the support it had given Ukraine could not prevent Russia from winning the war. Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who watched the Soviet Union crumble while stationed in Dresden, took the decision to invade Ukraine himself with only limited counsel from a tiny group of trusted advisers, 10 Russian sources with knowledge of Kremlin thinking told Reuters. He will likewise have the deciding voice on any ceasefire, according to the five current and former officials. The Kremlin chief presents what he calls the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine as a watershed moment when Moscow finally stood up to what he sees as the arrogance of the West which enlarged NATO eastwards towards Russia's borders and meddled in the politics of what Moscow considers as its own backyard, including Georgia and, crucially, Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say the invasion was an attempt to grab sovereign Ukrainian territory. When asked what a possible ceasefire might look like, two of the Russian sources referred to a draft agreement that was almost approved in April 2022 after talks in Istanbul, and which Putin has referred to in public as a possible basis for a deal. Under that draft, opens new tab, a copy of which Reuters has seen, Ukraine should agree to permanent neutrality in return for international security guarantees from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. One of the Russian officials said there would be no agreement unless Ukraine received security guarantees, adding: ""The question is how to avoid a deal that locks the West into a possible direct confrontation with Russia one day."""

According to the Sun tabloid, the incident occurred shortly before midnight on October 13. The intruders broke into Shaw Farm, a working facility on the estate, by scaling a six-foot fence. They then accessed a farm building and stole a black Isuzu pickup truck and a red quad bike, police confirmed. During their escape, the thieves rammed through a security barrier at the farm gate, triggering an alert that notified staff of the break-in. The farm gate, frequently used by the royal family, suffered damage during the incident. The sprawling 16,000-acre Windsor estate, located 20 miles west of London, serves as the residence of Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and their three children, who live at Adelaide Cottage. The family was reportedly home at the time of the burglary, although King Charles and Queen Camilla, who occasionally stay at Windsor Castle, were not present. This incident adds to a history of security breaches at royal properties. In 2021, a man armed with a crossbow was arrested at Windsor Castle after declaring his intent to harm Queen Elizabeth. Earlier in 1982, an intruder entered Buckingham Palace and reached Queen Elizabeth’s bedroom, where he spoke with her briefly before security intervened.

In a boost for the beleaguered country, U.S. President Joe Biden gave the green light for U.S. missiles to be used against targets deeper inside Russia, potentially limiting its options to launch attacks and supply the front. But the dramatic shift in policy may be reversed when Trump returns to the White House in January, and military experts cautioned that it would not be enough on its own to change the course of the 33-month-old war. Thousands of Ukrainian citizens have died, over 6 million live as refugees abroad and the population has fallen by a quarter since Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion by land, sea and air that began Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two. Military losses have been catastrophic, although they remain closely guarded secrets. Public Western estimates based on intelligence reports vary widely, but most say hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded on each side. Tragedy has touched families in every corner of Ukraine, where military funerals are commonplace in major cities and far-flung villages, and people are exhausted by sleepless nights of air raid sirens and anguish. Now the return of Trump, who has vowed to end the fighting quickly - without saying how - calls into question the future of U.S. military aid and the united Western front against Putin, and raises the prospect of talks to end the war. PROSPECT OF TALKS PROMPTS ESCALATION With Ukraine entering uncharted territory, a sense of escalation has been palpable as Moscow and Kyiv push to improve their battlefield positions ahead of any negotiations. Already boosted by Iranian attack drones and North Korean artillery shells and ballistic missiles, Russia has now deployed 11,000 North Korean troops, some of whom Kyiv says have clashed with Ukrainian forces who have seized a part of Russia's Kursk region. One senior Kyiv official said Pyongyang had the capacity to send 100,000 soldiers. Ukraine meanwhile has some of its best troops trying to hold that small piece of Russian territory, captured in August as a bargaining chip. Kyiv says Russia has massed 50,000 troops there, while the Kremlin's forces have also been making their quickest gains in the east of Ukraine since 2022 - and stepping up pressure in the northeast and southeast too. With winter setting in, Moscow on Sunday renewed its aerial assault on Ukraine's struggling power system, firing 120 missiles and 90 drones in the biggest aerial barrage since August. In addition to the U.S. authorisation to strike military targets inside Russia with American-supplied weapons, external financial and arms aid also remain vital. Despite two consecutive years of moderate growth, the Ukrainian economy is still only 78% of the size it was before the invasion, which saw GDP contract by a third in 2022. Ukraine's once-giant steel and grain industries have been hammered. RUSSIA DEMANDS UKRAINE GIVE UP TERRITORY AND NATO AMBITION The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission has verified the deaths of 11,743 Ukrainian civilians, though some Kyiv officials believe the number is much higher. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that Ukraine must do its best to end the war next year through diplomatic means. But he has emphatically shut down any talk of a ceasefire before proper security guarantees are provided to Ukraine. The Kremlin has said its war objectives remain unchanged since Putin said in June that Ukraine must drop its ambitions to join NATO, and must retreat from four Ukrainian regions that his forces partially control, all tantamount to capitulation for Kyiv. A sea of small Ukrainian flags honouring the dead now occupies a corner of Kyiv's Independence Square, once the beating heart of the mass pro-European protests that toppled Ukraine's then Moscow-backed president in 2014. Russia responded to the protests by seizing Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula, Crimea, and backing a paramilitary insurgency in the east that killed 14,000 people before two series of talks, in the so-called Minsk format, halted the fighting with Kyiv. After German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Putin on Friday for the first time in nearly two years, Zelenskiy said the move reduced the Russian leader's isolation. He also spoke out against the idea of renewed Minsk-style talks. ""We want to warn everyone: there will be no 'Minsk 3'; what we need is real peace,"" he said."

Starting his speech, Shehbaz congratulated Azerbaijan’s president for hosting the summit and emphasized the dire consequences faced by Pakistan and several other vulnerable nations due to climate change. ""If timely measures are not taken, there will be more damage in the future,"" he warned. Prime Minister Sharif highlighted Pakistan's ongoing recovery from the devastating 2022 floods due to environmental changes, which caused more than $30 billion in damages, destroyed thousands of acres of crops, left numerous buildings, including schools, in ruins, and displaced thousands of people. He stressed that Pakistan, despite contributing only minimally to global emissions, ranks among the top 10 countries most affected by climate change. ""The world promised to help Pakistan following the damage caused by the environmental disaster,"" he recalled. Shehbaz urged global leaders to honour commitments made during COP28, noting that the pledges of financial assistance for climate-induced damages have not yet been fully implemented. ""If timely measures are not taken, we risk further catastrophic damage. We don't want other countries to face the same situation as Pakistan did,"" he warned. He outlined Pakistan's climate resilience efforts, including the development of a National Carbon Market Framework and an ambitious target to transition 30% of the country’s vehicles to alternative energy by the end of the decade. ""The world must help developing countries like Pakistan,"" the PM declared. Additionally, Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to investing in alternative energy sources, underlining the need for environmental protection on an emergency basis to ensure a safe future. PM Sharif further emphasized that Pakistan will transfer 30% of vehicles to alternative energy by the end of the decade, adding that developing countries required $6.8 trillion to implement Vision 2030. He also stressed the importance of grants rather than loans in climate finance for developing nations, arguing that such countries cannot bear additional debt. Sharif acknowledged the contributions of PPP leader Sherry Rehman in taking strong measures related to climate change. He warned that heavy losses may have to be borne if no measures are taken for the future, recalling that he had said two years ago that the future requires comprehensive measures. He concluded with a call for the international community’s support, stating, ""We cannot alone take measures against environmental pollution. The support and help of the international community will be needed."""

This unique celebration, inspired by the US President-elect’s somewhat awkward boogie moves from his campaign rallies, has rapidly gained traction across multiple sports disciplines, from the bloodied battlefields of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to the disciplined greens of the LPGA Tour. The trend first caught significant attention last week when US soccer star Christian Pulisic showcased his rendition after scoring a goal in a 4-2 victory over Jamaica.Rushing to the sideline with his teammates, Pulisic was seen fist-pumping and shimmying in a clear tribute to Trump’s signature on-stage shuffle. This celebration has now become synonymous with American athletes following standout performances. Trump's influence expands across sports The ""Donald Trump"" dance has been featured in numerous other events. On Saturday, UFC fighter Jon Jones, following his knockout victory over Stipe Miocic at Madison Square Garden, performed the hip-swinging celebration in front of a raucous crowd. With Trump sitting ringside, Jones proceeded to present the President-elect with his newly won heavyweight belt, completing the iconic moment with a nod to the viral dance. For many athletes, the dance has become a way to demonstrate personality and engage with current cultural moments. San Francisco 49ers player Nick Bosa was one of the first NFL players to popularize the move, dancing sacking an opponent during a game on November 10. His bold move came just days after he faced backlash for wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap at a postgame interview. “I wasn’t even going to do it, but the boys reminded me. And it was fun,” Bosa said of his decision to take part in the Trump dance. However, he declined to directly credit Trump as his inspiration, stating, “I think you know the answer to that question.” NFL and collegiate players alike have followed suit, with several athletes incorporating the dance into their celebrations, much to the delight of fans and commentators. Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers was seen performing the dance after scoring a touchdown in his team's loss to the Miami Dolphins. Bowers later admitted to having been inspired by Jones’ performance in the UFC fight the previous evening. The Trump dance goes global The cultural reach of the Trump dance even extended beyond the men’s leagues. On Sunday, England's Charley Hull was seen jokingly mimicking the signature shuffle during her final round match against Nelly Korda at the Annika tournament in Florida. As she walked down the fairway, the LPGA star’s playful nod to the viral trend added a surprising moment of levity to the professional golf event. As the Trump dance continues to spread, it seems to be gaining a life of its own. Former US international soccer player Alexi Lalas expressed his amusement at Pulisic’s move, sharing his excitement on X (formerly Twitter). “Pulisic scores. Pulisic does the Trump dance. We’re winning the World Cup…bigly,” Lalas tweeted, using a well-known Trumpism to celebrate the growing trend. The dance, a curious fusion of athletic celebration and political influence, has transcended its origins as a political gimmick to become an expression of personality within the sporting world. Whether in the UFC, NFL, or LPGA, athletes are embracing the move as a fun and infectious way to celebrate success."

In his first remarks at the G20 Summit, Xi said China would support global development with eight actions, including building a ""high quality"" Belt and Road Initiative, his signature foreign policy plan that directs large Chinese investments to infrastructure projects in the developing world. He also announced that China, along with Brazil, South Africa and the African Union, were launching an ""Open Science International Cooperation Initiative"" designed to funnel scientific and technological innovations to the Global South. ""China supports the G20 in carrying out practical cooperation for the benefit of the Global South,"" Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua, adding that China's imports from developing countries are expected to top $8 trillion between now and 2030. ""China has always been a member of the 'Global South', a reliable and long-term partner of developing countries, and an activist and doer in support of global development,"" Xi added. ""China does not seek to be a single player, but rather hopes that 100 flowers will blossom and that it will work hand in hand with the vast number of developing countries to achieve modernization."" Xi's focus on the Global South comes as Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his peers from developing economies push for a more central role in multilateral talks. The two leaders will meet in Brasilia on Wednesday, as Xi wraps up his stay in Brazil with a state visit. Brazil has taken strides to elevate voices of the Global South by insisting that the African Union should be a formal member of the G20, citing the example of the European Union. The AU is participating fully in this year's G20 on behalf of African nations. While the rise of the Global South in the G20 has caused some discomfort among richer countries, it presents an opportunity for China, given its close economic and political ties with most of the developing world, particularly in Africa, where it is a major lender. The G20 was launched after the 2007–08 financial crisis to include important emerging economies in talks that had been confined to the Group of Seven industrialized nations, and has become a key venue for economic and financial cooperation. It represents around 85% of global GDP, over 75% of global trade and about two-thirds of the world population. The concept of the Global South emerged to designate developing, emerging or lower-income countries, mostly in the southern hemisphere, and replace the term ""Third World"" after the 1945-90 Cold War."

Biden announced the US pledge during a closed session of the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The amount is a record and substantially exceeds the $3.5 billion Washington committed in the previous IDA fund replenishment round in December 2021. A White House spokesperson in Washington declined comment on the World Bank's IDA replenishment. It is unclear if US President-elect Donald Trump, who has proposed cutting foreign aid in the past, will honour Biden's pledge as he and billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk seek to slash US spending through a new government efficiency panel. An appropriation by the US Congress to fund the commitment would not likely take place until after Trump takes office in January. A spokesperson for Trump's transition team could not immediately be reached for comment. Earlier in Rio de Janeiro, US deputy national security adviser Jonathan Finer told reporters that Biden would announce a ""historic"" pledge to the IDA replenishment. Finer also told reporters at a briefing on the G20 summit that Biden will launch a bilateral clean energy partnership when he meets Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Tuesday. The World Bank's IDA fund, which provides mainly grants and very low interest loans to the poorest countries, is replenished every three years, and a pledging conference is scheduled for Dec 6. World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming for a record amount exceeding the $93 billion refunding in December 2021, amid rising demands from poor nations in Africa and elsewhere that are struggling with crushing debts, climate disasters, conflict and other pressures. Banga told Reuters in October that a $120 billion replenishment is possible, but that goal would require some substantial increases in country commitments. Biden's new US commitment is about 14.3% higher than its 2021 contribution. At the IMF-World Bank annual meetings in October, Spain announced plans to boost its contribution by 37% to 400 million euros ($423 million). Denmark in September announced a 40% increase in its contribution to about $492 million."
"448","International","G20 talks in Rio reach breakthrough on climate finance, sources say","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324154-g20-talks-in-rio-reach-breakthrough-on-climate-finance-sources-say","Diplomatic tensions over global warming spilled over into the G20 summit negotiations in Brazil this week, with sources saying the 20 major economies reached a fragile consensus on climate finance that had eluded U.N. talks in Azerbaijan. Heads of state arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday for the G20 summit and will spend Monday and Tuesday addressing issues from poverty and hunger to the reform of global institutions. The talks must now also grapple with how to address escalating violence in Ukraine after a deadly Russian airstrike on Sunday. Still, the ongoing U.N. climate talks have thrown a spotlight on their efforts to tackle global warming. While the COP29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, is tasked with agreeing a goal to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars for climate, leaders of the Group of 20 major economies half a world away in Rio are holding the purse strings. G20 countries account for 85% of the world's economy and are the largest contributors to multilateral development banks helping to steer climate finance. ""The spotlight is naturally on the G20. They account for 80 percent of global emissions,"" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. He expressed concern about the state of the COP29 talks in Baku and called on G20 leaders to do more to fight climate change. ""Now is the time for leadership by example from the world's largest economies and emitters,"" Guterres said. U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell wrote a letter to G20 leaders on Saturday imploring them to act on climate finance, including boosting grants for developing nations and advancing reforms of multilateral development banks. However, the same fights that have plagued COP29 since it began last week became central to G20 negotiations, according to diplomats close to the Rio talks. COP29 must set a new goal for how much financing should be directed from developed countries, multilateral banks and the private sector to developing nations. Economists told the summit it should be at least $1 trillion. Wealthy countries, especially in Europe, have been saying that an ambitious goal can only be agreed if they expand the base of contributors to include some of the richer developing nations, such as China and major Middle Eastern oil producers. On Saturday, discussions of a G20 joint statement in Rio snagged on the same issue, with European nations pushing for more countries to contribute and developing countries such as Brazil pushing back, diplomats close to the talks told Reuters. But early Sunday morning, negotiators agreed to a text mentioning developing nations' voluntary contributions to climate finance, stopping short of calling them obligations, according to two diplomats. The breakthrough remains overshadowed by the return to power of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who is reportedly preparing to again pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. His election throws into doubt how much money the world can muster to address climate change, possibly without the support of the world's largest economy. Trump is planning to roll back landmark climate legislation passed by outgoing President Joe Biden, who visited the Amazon rainforest when he made a stop there on Sunday on his way to Rio. The success of not only COP29 but also the next U.N. climate summit, COP30 hosted in Brazil next year, hinges on an ambitious deal on climate finance. A centerpiece of Brazil's COP30 strategy is ""Mission 1.5,"" a drive to keep alive the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The U.N. estimates that current national targets would cause temperatures to rise by at least 2.6 degrees C, opens new tab. Developing countries argue they can only raise their targets for emissions reductions if rich nations, who are the main culprits for climate change, foot the bill. ""It is technically possible to meet the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius, but only if a G20-led, massive mobilization to cut all greenhouse gas emissions ... is achieved,"" said Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis at COP29 last week."

The lawsuit, led by Malcolm X's daughter, Ilyasah Shabazz, and other family members, claims that these law enforcement agencies were aware of the plot to kill him but failed to take action to prevent it. At a press conference, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing the family, stated, “We believe that they all conspired to assassinate Malcolm X, one of the greatest thought leaders of the 20th century."" The wrongful death lawsuit was revealed at a memorial center in New York City, the site where Malcolm X was killed in 1965. It seeks to uncover the truth behind his assassination and correct the historical record, as well as demand justice for the family's suffering. “As a direct result of the Defendants’ intentional, bad faith, willful, wanton, reckless, unreasonable and/or deliberately indifferent acts and omissions, Malcolm X was deprived of his federal constitutional rights, was robbed of his life and freedom, and sustained severe physical, emotional, and monetary damages, including conscious physical pain and suffering,” the lawsuit states. Crump also highlighted that the lawsuit aims to bring reparations to the family. There was no immediate response from the FBI, CIA, or NYPD on the matter. “This cover-up spanned decades, blocking the Shabazz family’s access to the truth and their right to pursue justice,” Crump said in a statement. “We are making history by standing here to confront those wrongs and seeking accountability in the courts.” Malcolm X gained prominence as the national spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, an African American Muslim group advocating for Black separatism. After parting ways with the Nation in 1964, he moderated some of his earlier views on racial separation, which led to death threats from former members. Talmadge Hayer, a former member of the Nation of Islam, later confessed to being one of the three men who assassinated Malcolm X. However, suspicions that the government may have had knowledge of the plot and allowed it to happen have persisted for years. Ilyasah Shabazz, who was only two years old when her father was murdered on February 21, 1965, was present with her mother and siblings when the shooting occurred at New York’s Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights."

This development follows the Biden administration’s recent approval to allow Ukraine to use long-range weapons for operations inside Russian territory. The strikes targeted a military facility in Russia’s Bryansk region, over 110 km from Ukraine. Moscow claimed that its air defence systems intercepted five of the six missiles, with debris from one causing a minor fire at the site. The Russian Defense Ministry reported no casualties or significant damage. Conversely, Ukraine stated that it hit an arms depot, resulting in secondary explosions. While Kyiv did not officially confirm the use of ATACMS, both a Ukrainian government source and a U.S. official affirmed the deployment of the missiles. According to the U.S., Russia intercepted two of the eight missiles fired during the attack. Lavrov: “Clear signal of western escalation” Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized the move, saying the use of ATACMS demonstrates Western intent to escalate the war. Moscow further alleged that the missiles could not be operated without U.S. operational support, which it claims makes Washington a direct participant in the conflict. These developments come as Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine on Tuesday, lowering the threshold for nuclear weapon use to include attacks threatening Russia’s territorial integrity. The U.S. dismissed this as a continuation of “irresponsible rhetoric.” In addition to the missile strikes, Russia reported destroying 42 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 32 in Bryansk, during two hours on Tuesday evening. Ukrainian drones have been a persistent feature of the war, but the scale of the latest deployment was described as unusual. At the United Nations, Ukraine’s Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya reaffirmed the international community’s condemnation of Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory. He urged continued resolve to uphold international law, stating that the war’s 1,000th day underscores the need for global unity. As Ukraine and Russia engage in intensified military actions, the human toll remains staggering. According to the United Nations, over 12,000 civilians have been killed and nearly 27,000 injured since the conflict began. Millions of Ukrainians remain displaced, with the country’s population reduced by a quarter. Military casualties are similarly heavy, with public Western estimates citing hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed or wounded on both sides. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, addressing his parliament, called for sustained efforts to end the war diplomatically within the next year. ""It is being decided who will prevail—those who wish to live freely, or those under the rule of a dictator,"" he declared. Western support and geopolitical shifts Despite Ukraine’s reliance on Western support, questions linger as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to assume office. Trump has criticized extensive U.S. aid to Kyiv, hinting at a potential push for peace talks. Meanwhile, Denmark announced a new $138 million arms donation to Ukraine, and the U.S. approved a potential $100 million military equipment sale. Military experts, however, remain skeptical about the strategic impact of Ukraine’s use of ATACMS missiles, noting their limited range compared to Russia’s arsenal. As winter approaches, Russia has renewed its aerial campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, launching its largest barrage since August. While trench warfare continues to devastate eastern Ukrainian cities, Moscow claims incremental advances, including capturing a settlement on Tuesday. The war shows no signs of abating, with neither side signaling flexibility on their negotiating positions. Kyiv demands the withdrawal of Russian forces from all occupied territories, while Moscow insists on Ukraine abandoning NATO ambitions and recognizing its annexations."
"451","International","Indian students protest Oxford Union debate on 'Free Kashmir'","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324257-indian-students-protest-oxford-union-debate-on-free-kashmir","Indian students have staged a protest against the Oxford Union after the prestigious debating society hosted a discussion on the topic of ""Free Kashmir,"" a longstanding issue between India and Pakistan. The protest highlighted the growing influence of Hindutva ideology, which critics argue has become deeply entrenched in India's political and social fabric under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Kashmir issue, rooted in the aftermath of British colonialism, has been a point of contention in South Asia since 1947, resulting in multiple wars and persistent tensions. Kashmiris have long fought for their right to self-determination, seeking greater political autonomy or independence. However, Indian students' response to the Oxford Union debate reveals a shift in India’s political climate, with increasing displays of nationalism and pride—often fueled by disinformation and historical distortion—becoming more pronounced in global protests. Experts and historians argue that the behavior exhibited by the protesting students reflects a broader trend in India, where a nationalistic agenda is often propelled by the Hindutva ideology. This ideological framework aims to transform India into a Hindu-majority state, marginalizing non-Hindu communities. The rise of Hindutva, championed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliate, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has significantly altered India's political landscape, undermining its secular foundations. Despite India's constitutional guarantees of secularism, the country has increasingly moved away from this ideal, with the state failing to protect the rights of minorities, particularly in Kashmir. India has become one of the most prominent human rights violators globally, with systematic violations of minority rights taking place across Indian-administered Kashmir and mainland India, often with the tacit approval of the state. The recent protest at the Oxford Union, an institution known for its commitment to free speech and intellectual debate, underscores the need for a renewed social contract in India. The protest also raises important questions about India's ability to engage in constructive international dialogue, particularly regarding the Kashmir dispute. It highlights a disturbing trend within parts of the Indian diaspora, which, at times, challenges the values and principles upheld in Western democracies. The protest, described as unprecedented in the Union's history, signals a worrying shift away from principles of free expression and open dialogue. The Indian students' actions have raised alarms, as they suggest a growing unwillingness to engage with differing viewpoints, which undermines the spirit of debate and discussion that is central to academic institutions. The debate itself, centered on Kashmir's political status, offered a platform for challenging India's narrative on the issue and drawing international attention to the complexities surrounding the region. While India insists on its sovereignty over Kashmir, the international community increasingly views the situation through a broader lens, one that questions India's approach to the Kashmir issue. As global awareness and interest in the Kashmir conflict rise, India is urged to confront historical truths and recognize the diverse perspectives surrounding the dispute."

According to the Sun tabloid, the incident occurred shortly before midnight on October 13. The intruders broke into Shaw Farm, a working facility on the estate, by scaling a six-foot fence. They then accessed a farm building and stole a black Isuzu pickup truck and a red quad bike, police confirmed. During their escape, the thieves rammed through a security barrier at the farm gate, triggering an alert that notified staff of the break-in. The farm gate, frequently used by the royal family, suffered damage during the incident. The sprawling 16,000-acre Windsor estate, located 20 miles west of London, serves as the residence of Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and their three children, who live at Adelaide Cottage. The family was reportedly home at the time of the burglary, although King Charles and Queen Camilla, who occasionally stay at Windsor Castle, were not present. This incident adds to a history of security breaches at royal properties. In 2021, a man armed with a crossbow was arrested at Windsor Castle after declaring his intent to harm Queen Elizabeth. Earlier in 1982, an intruder entered Buckingham Palace and reached Queen Elizabeth’s bedroom, where he spoke with her briefly before security intervened. Police are continuing their investigation into the October theft, but no arrests have been made yet."

Taking to X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, the Thiruvananthapuram MP said the situation had become “unconscionable,” criticizing the government for failing to tackle the pollution crisis despite years of deterioration. Tharoor remarked, “Our government has been witnessing this nightmare for years and does nothing about it,” highlighting the urgency of the issue.  Tharoor’s comments come amidst a dire air quality situation, with Delhi often recording the worst air quality in the world during winter months. On Monday, the city reached an AQI of 493, placing it in the 'severe plus' category and prompting authorities to declare online classes for all students from Tuesday. Tharoor’s post also included his own past efforts to address the pollution, including launching an Air Quality Round Table in 2015 with experts and stakeholders. However, he abandoned the initiative last year due to the lack of progress. The Congress veteran further described the national capital as “uninhabitable” from November to January and “barely liveable” for the rest of the year, raising the provocative question, “Should it even remain the nation’s capital?” This is not the first time Tharoor has called attention to the pollution crisis in Delhi. Earlier this month, when the AQI reached a staggering 462, he humorously renamed some of Delhi’s iconic locations in a satirical post on X, including 'Pollutyens Delhi,' 'Haze Khas,' and 'Chandni Choke.' He also took a swipe at the government’s recent renaming of Central Vista's 'Rajpath' to 'Martavya Path,' saying, “No wonder they renamed the main road!” The Supreme Court has also expressed severe concerns over Delhi’s deteriorating air quality. On Monday, the court sharply criticised both the Delhi government and the Centre’s Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for their delay in enforcing the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). The court has now ordered that Stage 4 restrictions under GRAP remain in effect until further notice."

According to a statement from Hezbollah, the operation involved a ""squadron of qualitative attack drones"" aimed at undisclosed military points within the city. The group promised further details on the targets later. Meanwhile, Israeli emergency services reported injuries in the suburbs of Tel Aviv following rocket fire, with five individuals receiving medical attention. The development marks an escalation in the ongoing conflict, raising concerns about intensified regional hostilities. Israeli authorities have yet to respond to Hezbollah's claims. Lebanon and Hezbollah have agreed to a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire with Israel with some comments on the content, a top Lebanese official told Reuters on Monday, describing the effort as the most serious yet to end the fighting. Ali Hassan Khalil, an aide to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, said Lebanon had delivered its written response to the U.S. ambassador in Lebanon on Monday, and White House envoy Amos Hochstein was travelling to Beirut to continue talks. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Hezbollah, a heavily armed movement backed by Iran, endorsed its long-time ally Berri to negotiate over a ceasefire. ""Lebanon presented its comments on the paper in a positive atmosphere,"" Khalil said, declining to give further details. ""All the comments that we presented affirm the precise adherence to (U.N.) Resolution 1701 with all its provisions,"" he said.

Its terms require Hezbollah to have no armed presence in the area between the Lebanese-Israeli border and the Litani River, which runs some 30 km (20 miles) north of the frontier. Khalil said the success of the initiative now depended on Israel, saying if Israel did not want a solution, ""it could make 100 problems"". Israel has long claimed that Resolution 1701 was never properly implemented, pointing to the presence of Hezbollah fighters and weapons along the border. Lebanon has accused Israel of violations including flying warplanes in its airspace. Khalil said Israel was trying to negotiate ""under fire"", a reference to an escalation of its bombardment of Beirut and the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. ""This won't affect our position,"" he said."

In a boost for the beleaguered country, U.S. President Joe Biden gave the green light for U.S. missiles to be used against targets deeper inside Russia, potentially limiting its options to launch attacks and supply the front. But the dramatic shift in policy may be reversed when Trump returns to the White House in January, and military experts cautioned that it would not be enough on its own to change the course of the 33-month-old war. Thousands of Ukrainian citizens have died, over 6 million live as refugees abroad and the population has fallen by a quarter since Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion by land, sea and air that began Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two. Military losses have been catastrophic, although they remain closely guarded secrets. Public Western estimates based on intelligence reports vary widely, but most say hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded on each side. Tragedy has touched families in every corner of Ukraine, where military funerals are commonplace in major cities and far-flung villages, and people are exhausted by sleepless nights of air raid sirens and anguish. Now the return of Trump, who has vowed to end the fighting quickly - without saying how - calls into question the future of U.S. military aid and the united Western front against Putin, and raises the prospect of talks to end the war. PROSPECT OF TALKS PROMPTS ESCALATION With Ukraine entering uncharted territory, a sense of escalation has been palpable as Moscow and Kyiv push to improve their battlefield positions ahead of any negotiations. Already boosted by Iranian attack drones and North Korean artillery shells and ballistic missiles, Russia has now deployed 11,000 North Korean troops, some of whom Kyiv says have clashed with Ukrainian forces who have seized a part of Russia's Kursk region. One senior Kyiv official said Pyongyang had the capacity to send 100,000 soldiers. Ukraine meanwhile has some of its best troops trying to hold that small piece of Russian territory, captured in August as a bargaining chip. Kyiv says Russia has massed 50,000 troops there, while the Kremlin's forces have also been making their quickest gains in the east of Ukraine since 2022 - and stepping up pressure in the northeast and southeast too. With winter setting in, Moscow on Sunday renewed its aerial assault on Ukraine's struggling power system, firing 120 missiles and 90 drones in the biggest aerial barrage since August. In addition to the U.S. authorisation to strike military targets inside Russia with American-supplied weapons, external financial and arms aid also remain vital. Despite two consecutive years of moderate growth, the Ukrainian economy is still only 78% of the size it was before the invasion, which saw GDP contract by a third in 2022. Ukraine's once-giant steel and grain industries have been hammered. RUSSIA DEMANDS UKRAINE GIVE UP TERRITORY AND NATO AMBITION The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission has verified the deaths of 11,743 Ukrainian civilians, though some Kyiv officials believe the number is much higher. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that Ukraine must do its best to end the war next year through diplomatic means. But he has emphatically shut down any talk of a ceasefire before proper security guarantees are provided to Ukraine. The Kremlin has said its war objectives remain unchanged since Putin said in June that Ukraine must drop its ambitions to join NATO, and must retreat from four Ukrainian regions that his forces partially control, all tantamount to capitulation for Kyiv. A sea of small Ukrainian flags honouring the dead now occupies a corner of Kyiv's Independence Square, once the beating heart of the mass pro-European protests that toppled Ukraine's then Moscow-backed president in 2014. Russia responded to the protests by seizing Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula, Crimea, and backing a paramilitary insurgency in the east that killed 14,000 people before two series of talks, in the so-called Minsk format, halted the fighting with Kyiv. After German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Putin on Friday for the first time in nearly two years, Zelenskiy said the move reduced the Russian leader's isolation. He also spoke out against the idea of renewed Minsk-style talks. ""We want to warn everyone: there will be no 'Minsk 3'; what we need is real peace,"" he said."
"457","International","Russia issues chilling warning over US weapons in Ukraine conflict","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324203-russia-issues-chilling-warning-over-us-weapons-in-ukraine-conflict","Russia has vowed to deliver a “tangible” response should Ukraine use US-supplied long-range missiles against its territory, escalating tensions as the war in Ukraine enters its 1,000th day. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday warned that such attacks would be seen as ""direct involvement"" by the United States and its allies in hostilities against Moscow. The statement came days after US President Joe Biden approved the transfer of ATACMS missiles to Ukraine, lifting previous restrictions on their use within Russian borders. The decision marks a significant policy shift, with far-reaching implications for the conflict. The ATACMS missiles, with a range of 300km, complement Ukraine's existing arsenal, which includes similar long-range weapons from France and the UK. International reactions and battlefield dynamics Biden’s approval has drawn a mixed response globally. French President Emmanuel Macron lauded it as a “good step,” but Russia’s government accused Washington of “adding oil to the fire.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned of severe consequences for US involvement in the conflict. In an unusual development, more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers have reportedly arrived in Russia’s western Kursk region, with unconfirmed reports suggesting Pyongyang could deploy up to 100,000 troops to bolster President Vladimir Putin's military campaign. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has remained cryptic about the missile deal, stating that “the missiles will speak for themselves.” Speculation is rife that Ukraine may use the newly provided weapons in the contested Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces hold a small piece of territory. The conflict continues to take a heavy toll. Russian strikes over the weekend targeted Ukraine’s power grid, leading to widespread blackouts and multiple casualties. On Monday, a Russian attack on Odesa killed 10 people and injured nearly 50, compounding the humanitarian crisis. The battlefield appears deadlocked, with neither side gaining significant ground in recent months. Analysts view the introduction of long-range missiles as a potential game-changer, although it risks further escalation. Political stakes in Washington The decision comes as President Biden prepares to leave office in January, raising questions about continuity in US policy under his successor, President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, who won the November 5 election, has pledged to end the war within 24 hours of taking office but has yet to provide specifics. Trump’s promise aligns with his broader agenda of reducing US involvement in foreign conflicts, but critics question whether his approach could lead to a sustainable peace deal. As tensions mount, Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for restraint and urged world leaders to seek a political solution to the Ukraine crisis. Beijing, a critical ally for Moscow amid Western sanctions, continues to advocate for dialogue, although its role in supplying weapons to Russia remains a contentious issue. The US missile decision underscores a deepening international divide over the Ukraine war. While Biden's move is seen as a strategic signal to Russia, its long-term impact on the conflict remains uncertain, particularly with Trump’s impending presidency. For now, Ukraine braces for what could be a critical turning point in a war that has reshaped the geopolitical landscape."

Benny Tai, a renowned legal scholar and central figure in Hong Kong’s 2019 anti-government protests, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Prosecutors labelled him the “organiser” of an alleged conspiracy involving a primary election among pro-democracy activists and politicians in July 2020. The primary, held to select candidates for the city’s legislature, aimed to secure a majority that could potentially block government budgets and force the Chief Executive to dissolve the legislature. However, authorities alleged the move constituted a plot to “overthrow” the government, leading to mass arrests under the sweeping National Security Law (NSL) imposed by Beijing in 2020. Out of the 47 individuals charged, 31 had pleaded guilty earlier, while 14 contested the charges. In May, the court found all 14 guilty of subversion, except for former district councillors Laurence Lau and Lee Yue-shu, who were acquitted. Under the NSL, penalties for “primary offenders” can reach life imprisonment, while those deemed secondary offenders face three to five years in prison. The lengthy sentences handed down to Tai and others underscore the severity of the court’s interpretation of the law. Many of the defendants had been on remand since their arrests in 2021, enduring legal delays exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The case has drawn international condemnation as an emblem of the ongoing erosion of freedoms promised under the “one country, two systems” framework established when Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. Critics argue the NSL, introduced to suppress dissent after the 2019 protests, effectively silences opposition voices in the city. Benny Tai’s role as a central figure in the movement has made his sentencing particularly significant. Known for his academic contributions and leadership in civil disobedience movements, Tai was a key figure in the 2014 Umbrella Movement and later played a pivotal role in mobilising protests against Beijing's tightening grip. Human rights groups and Western governments have expressed grave concerns over the sentences, describing them as politically motivated and part of a broader campaign to eliminate dissent. The Hong Kong government, however, has defended the case as a lawful response to “criminal acts” that threatened the city’s stability. With most prominent leaders now in exile, imprisoned, or silenced, the future of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement appears bleak.Analysts believe the recent wave of prosecutions and convictions under the NSL sends a chilling message to those seeking to oppose Beijing’s tightening control."

In his first remarks at the G20 Summit, Xi said China would support global development with eight actions, including building a ""high quality"" Belt and Road Initiative, his signature foreign policy plan that directs large Chinese investments to infrastructure projects in the developing world. He also announced that China, along with Brazil, South Africa and the African Union, were launching an ""Open Science International Cooperation Initiative"" designed to funnel scientific and technological innovations to the Global South. ""China supports the G20 in carrying out practical cooperation for the benefit of the Global South,"" Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua, adding that China's imports from developing countries are expected to top $8 trillion between now and 2030. ""China has always been a member of the 'Global South', a reliable and long-term partner of developing countries, and an activist and doer in support of global development,"" Xi added. ""China does not seek to be a single player, but rather hopes that 100 flowers will blossom and that it will work hand in hand with the vast number of developing countries to achieve modernization."" Xi's focus on the Global South comes as Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his peers from developing economies push for a more central role in multilateral talks. The two leaders will meet in Brasilia on Wednesday, as Xi wraps up his stay in Brazil with a state visit. Brazil has taken strides to elevate voices of the Global South by insisting that the African Union should be a formal member of the G20, citing the example of the European Union. The AU is participating fully in this year's G20 on behalf of African nations. While the rise of the Global South in the G20 has caused some discomfort among richer countries, it presents an opportunity for China, given its close economic and political ties with most of the developing world, particularly in Africa, where it is a major lender. The G20 was launched after the 2007–08 financial crisis to include important emerging economies in talks that had been confined to the Group of Seven industrialized nations, and has become a key venue for economic and financial cooperation. It represents around 85% of global GDP, over 75% of global trade and about two-thirds of the world population. The concept of the Global South emerged to designate developing, emerging or lower-income countries, mostly in the southern hemisphere, and replace the term ""Third World"" after the 1945-90 Cold War."

Biden announced the US pledge during a closed session of the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The amount is a record and substantially exceeds the $3.5 billion Washington committed in the previous IDA fund replenishment round in December 2021. A White House spokesperson in Washington declined comment on the World Bank's IDA replenishment. It is unclear if US President-elect Donald Trump, who has proposed cutting foreign aid in the past, will honour Biden's pledge as he and billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk seek to slash US spending through a new government efficiency panel. An appropriation by the US Congress to fund the commitment would not likely take place until after Trump takes office in January. A spokesperson for Trump's transition team could not immediately be reached for comment. Earlier in Rio de Janeiro, US deputy national security adviser Jonathan Finer told reporters that Biden would announce a ""historic"" pledge to the IDA replenishment. Finer also told reporters at a briefing on the G20 summit that Biden will launch a bilateral clean energy partnership when he meets Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Tuesday. The World Bank's IDA fund, which provides mainly grants and very low interest loans to the poorest countries, is replenished every three years, and a pledging conference is scheduled for Dec 6. World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming for a record amount exceeding the $93 billion refunding in December 2021, amid rising demands from poor nations in Africa and elsewhere that are struggling with crushing debts, climate disasters, conflict and other pressures. Banga told Reuters in October that a $120 billion replenishment is possible, but that goal would require some substantial increases in country commitments. Biden's new US commitment is about 14.3% higher than its 2021 contribution. At the IMF-World Bank annual meetings in October, Spain announced plans to boost its contribution by 37% to 400 million euros ($423 million). Denmark in September announced a 40% increase in its contribution to about $492 million."

However, there is no official confirmation yet. Sources indicate that Bishnoi, who allegedly coordinated gang activities alongside Goldy Brar from the US, was detained approximately four to five days ago. His last known location was Fresno, California, but it remains unclear if the detention occurred there. Efforts are underway to gather further details through official channels. This marks the second significant detention of a wanted gangster in recent weeks, following Arshdeep Singh Gill, alias Arsh Dalla’s, detention in Canada last month. US authorities were reportedly in contact with Mumbai Police regarding Bishnoi’s whereabouts. Mumbai Police are investigating his alleged involvement in two high-profile cases: a firing incident outside actor Salman Khan’s residence on April 14 and the killing of NCP leader Baba Siddique in Bandra East on October 12. Officials are preparing an extradition request for Bishnoi. Bishnoi has been listed as ‘most wanted’ by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), with a million INR reward for his capture. The NIA alleges that Bishnoi and Brar oversee the Lawrence Bishnoi gang’s operations from abroad, managing extortion rackets, killings, and connections with pro-Khalistan groups such as Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The Lawrence Bishnoi gang, active in multiple Indian states, has links with singers, industrialists, political figures, and the film industry, often targeting them for extortion. This nexus has drawn parallels to Mumbai’s underworld before the 1993 blasts. Anmol Bishnoi is also suspected of involvement in the murder of singer Sidhu Moosewala in May 2022. Authorities continue to investigate the extensive criminal network led by the gang’s overseas operatives."

""From tomorrow, physical classes shall be suspended for Class 10 and 12 as well, and all studies will be shifted online,"" Delhi Chief Minister Atishi posted on X. The decision followed the Supreme Court's directive to Delhi and NCR states to decide on online classes for all students and report back by Friday. Delhi's air quality deteriorated to hazardous levels, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 494, leaving residents struggling with breathing difficulties, itchy eyes, and sore throats. Doctors warned that the toxic air poses risks to both vulnerable groups and healthy individuals. The Supreme Court criticized the authorities in Delhi and NCR for delays in implementing Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which includes stricter anti-pollution measures. The court emphasized that restrictions under Stage 4 would remain in effect even if the AQI drops below 450. A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih questioned the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on its delayed response. “It is because of your fault that we are facing this situation today. In such a serious case, how do you wait for three days?” the court asked. “Till further orders are passed by this court, implementation of GRAP Stage 4 will continue even if AQI falls below 450,"" it added. Monday’s AQI reading of 494 was Delhi's worst in six years, with 15 of 39 monitoring stations recording the maximum value of 500. Nearby NCR cities also reported severe air quality, with AQI readings of 423 in Noida, 438 in Ghaziabad, and 469 in Gurugram."

The smog, a toxic blend of smoke and fog, happens each year in winter as cold air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from illegal farm fires in some surrounding states. Visibility dropped to 100 m (109 yards) in Delhi and Chandigarh, a city northwest of the capital, but authorities said flights and trains continued to operate with some delays. India's pollution control authority said the national capital territory's 24-hour air quality index (AQI) reading was at 484, classified as ""severe plus"", the highest this year. According to Swiss group IQAir's live rankings, New Delhi was the most polluted city in the world with the air quality at a ""hazardous"" 1,081 and the concentration of PM2.5 - particulate matter measuring 2.5 microns or less in diameter that can be carried into lungs, causing deadly diseases and cardiac issues - was 130.9 times the World Health Organisation's recommended levels. Experts say the scores vary because of a difference in the scale countries adopt to convert pollutant concentrations into AQI, and so the same quantity of a specific pollutant may be translated as different AQI scores in different countries. Delhi authorities directed all schools to move classes online and tightened restrictions on construction activities and vehicle movements, citing unfavourable meteorological conditions and low wind speed. Farm fires - where stubble left after harvesting rice is burnt to clear fields - have contributed as much as 40% of the pollution in Delhi, SAFAR, a weather forecasting agency under the ministry of earth sciences has said. Satellites detected 1,334 such events in six states on Sunday, the most in the last four days, according to India's Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modeling from Space. Despite the polluted air, many residents continued their daily routines. Many buildings were barely visible, including Delhi's iconic India Gate. ""Morning walk usually feels good, but now the air is polluted and we're forced to wear a mask... There is a burning sensation in the eyes and slight difficulty in breathing,"" Akshay Pathak, a resident of the city told the ANI news agency, in which Reuters has a minority stake. India's weather department has forecast ""dense to very dense fog"" for the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan for Monday."

Heads of state arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday for the G20 summit and will spend Monday and Tuesday addressing issues from poverty and hunger to the reform of global institutions. The talks must now also grapple with how to address escalating violence in Ukraine after a deadly Russian airstrike on Sunday. Still, the ongoing U.N. climate talks have thrown a spotlight on their efforts to tackle global warming. While the COP29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, is tasked with agreeing a goal to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars for climate, leaders of the Group of 20 major economies half a world away in Rio are holding the purse strings. G20 countries account for 85% of the world's economy and are the largest contributors to multilateral development banks helping to steer climate finance. ""The spotlight is naturally on the G20. They account for 80 percent of global emissions,"" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. He expressed concern about the state of the COP29 talks in Baku and called on G20 leaders to do more to fight climate change. ""Now is the time for leadership by example from the world's largest economies and emitters,"" Guterres said. U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell wrote a letter to G20 leaders on Saturday imploring them to act on climate finance, including boosting grants for developing nations and advancing reforms of multilateral development banks. However, the same fights that have plagued COP29 since it began last week became central to G20 negotiations, according to diplomats close to the Rio talks. COP29 must set a new goal for how much financing should be directed from developed countries, multilateral banks and the private sector to developing nations. Economists told the summit it should be at least $1 trillion. Wealthy countries, especially in Europe, have been saying that an ambitious goal can only be agreed if they expand the base of contributors to include some of the richer developing nations, such as China and major Middle Eastern oil producers. On Saturday, discussions of a G20 joint statement in Rio snagged on the same issue, with European nations pushing for more countries to contribute and developing countries such as Brazil pushing back, diplomats close to the talks told Reuters. But early Sunday morning, negotiators agreed to a text mentioning developing nations' voluntary contributions to climate finance, stopping short of calling them obligations, according to two diplomats. The breakthrough remains overshadowed by the return to power of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who is reportedly preparing to again pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. His election throws into doubt how much money the world can muster to address climate change, possibly without the support of the world's largest economy. Trump is planning to roll back landmark climate legislation passed by outgoing President Joe Biden, who visited the Amazon rainforest when he made a stop there on Sunday on his way to Rio. The success of not only COP29 but also the next U.N. climate summit, COP30 hosted in Brazil next year, hinges on an ambitious deal on climate finance. A centerpiece of Brazil's COP30 strategy is ""Mission 1.5,"" a drive to keep alive the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The U.N. estimates that current national targets would cause temperatures to rise by at least 2.6 degrees C, opens new tab. Developing countries argue they can only raise their targets for emissions reductions if rich nations, who are the main culprits for climate change, foot the bill. ""It is technically possible to meet the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius, but only if a G20-led, massive mobilization to cut all greenhouse gas emissions ... is achieved,"" said Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis at COP29 last week."

His remarks followed weeks of protests by Hindu communities, demanding better protection after a spate of attacks targeting homes, businesses, and temples. Yunus acknowledged the incidents but attributed them to political rivalries rather than communal hatred. ""These incidents have been given a communal colour, but they are politically motivated attempts to destabilise the country,"" the 84-year-old said. The Hindu community, constituting about 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million population, marked Durga Puja under tightened security. Official reports noted 35 incidents during the festivities, yet Yunus emphasized that Durga Puja was celebrated at nearly 32,000 pandals nationwide. ""Massive security arrangements ensured peaceful celebrations,"" he added. The Bangladesh Police stated that 17 suspects were arrested and 11 cases registered concerning the reported incidents. However, rights groups such as the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council highlighted over 2,000 attacks on Hindus since August, when Sheikh Hasina’s government was ousted. The violence has garnered global attention. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern during his Independence Day address, urging for the restoration of normalcy in Bangladesh. In response, Yunus assured Modi of his government’s commitment to minority safety. Human rights organisations and global leaders, including US President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, have condemned the attacks.While Biden pledged close monitoring of Bangladesh's human rights record, Trump described the violence as ""barbaric"" during his election campaign. The United Nations has also voiced concerns, urging the Bangladeshi interim government to ensure the safety and rights of its minority communities. Yunus reaffirmed his administration’s stance, saying, ""We are committed to safeguarding the rights of all religious minorities."""

The decision, revealed by two senior U.S. officials and a source familiar with the matter, comes amid escalating tensions in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The move follows months of appeals by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has persistently called for the loosening of restrictions on American arms to counter Russia’s military advances. Kyiv is expected to conduct its first such strikes in the coming days, sources indicated, though details remain under wraps due to operational security concerns. The decision marks a stark reversal of Washington’s earlier stance, which had sought to avoid direct escalation of the war. The Biden administration’s shift is reportedly in response to Russia’s deployment of North Korean troops to bolster its forces, a development that has heightened concerns in both Washington and Kyiv. Kremlin reaction loomsThe Kremlin has yet to issue an official response, but Russian lawmakers and officials have warned of dire consequences. Andrei Klishas, a senior member of Russia's Federation Council, described the policy change as ""a step towards the destruction of Ukrainian statehood,"" while Vladimir Dzhabarov, a key Russian senator, cautioned that the decision could lead to a global conflict. Zelensky, addressing the nation on Sunday, refrained from confirming the news outright but hinted at imminent action. ""Missiles will speak for themselves,"" he remarked, emphasizing that such measures are not announced in advance. Military implicationsUkraine is expected to deploy ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) for its long-range strikes. These missiles, with a range of approximately 306 kilometers, could enable Kyiv to target Russian military installations deep within its territory. While some U.S. officials remain skeptical about whether this change will decisively alter the course of the conflict, others see it as a potential game-changer that could strengthen Ukraine’s position in any future negotiations. Timing and political contextThe policy shift comes just two months before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Trump, who has consistently criticized U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine, has pledged to end the conflict quickly, though he has not outlined a specific plan. Richard Grenell, a close foreign policy adviser to Trump, criticized Biden's decision, describing it as an unnecessary escalation. ""Escalating wars before leaving office,"" Grenell posted on X (formerly Twitter). Biden administration officials, however, maintain that the remaining weeks of his presidency will be focused on equipping Ukraine to negotiate peace from a ""position of strength."" Concerns among alliesNATO countries have thus far refrained from permitting their supplied weapons to be used for strikes inside Russia, citing fears of provoking a broader conflict or a potential nuclear response. However, Poland’s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski defended Biden’s move, calling it a necessary response to Russia’s reliance on North Korean troops and increased missile attacks. Ukraine faces mounting pressure as Russian forces reportedly gain ground at their fastest pace since the war began in 2022. Meanwhile, the presence of over 10,000 North Korean soldiers in Russia's eastern regions has further stretched Ukrainian resources. Republican Representative Mike Turner, Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, welcomed the Biden administration’s decision but urged additional steps to aid Ukraine. ""This first step will pressure Putin as President-elect Trump prepares to end this war,"" Turner stated.  With Ukraine’s first long-range strikes imminent, the international community remains on edge. Whether this shift in U.S. policy will escalate the conflict or pave the way for peace remains to be seen."
"467","International","Clicks and conflicts: The digital face of South Asia’s wars","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324141-clicks-and-conflicts-the-digital-face-of-south-asia-s-wars","Social media is not just a passive observer in South Asia’s conflicts—it has evolved into an active participant. With every tweet, post, or video, narratives are framed, emotions are stirred, and in some cases, conflicts are exacerbated. The ability of these platforms to shape public perceptions has made them indispensable tools for journalists, activists, and political entities alike. However, this unprecedented power also carries inherent risks, as misinformation and hate speech often thrive alongside authentic narratives. This intricate role of social media in conflict reporting calls for a deeper exploration of its influence, potential, and pitfalls. New guardians of stories In South Asia, where traditional media is often constrained by political pressure or censorship, social media has emerged as a liberator of suppressed stories. Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook are now the frontlines where citizens document events as they unfold, often bypassing the gatekeeping of traditional media outlets. During the 2021 coup in Myanmar, for instance, videos and posts on social media exposed the violent crackdowns on protesters, prompting international condemnation. Similarly, in India, the plight of marginalized Dalit communities often comes to light through social media, where grassroots activists share raw, unfiltered realities that mainstream media sometimes overlooks. A case in point is the #FarmersProtest movement in India (2020-2021), which showcased the power of digital mobilization. Twitter, in particular, became a battleground for narratives, with hashtags like #StandWithFarmers and #FarmersProtest trending globally. The movement highlighted how social media could amplify the voices of the oppressed, bringing their struggles to the attention of both national and international audiences. While social media democratizes the flow of information, it also opens the floodgates to misinformation and hate speech. This darker side of digital storytelling has been evident in several South Asian conflicts. For instance, during the 2018 Sri Lankan riots, social media posts spread false rumors of Muslim-owned restaurants adding sterilization pills to food served to Buddhists. These unfounded claims fueled communal violence, prompting the government to temporarily block platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp. (Source) Similarly, the 2019 Pulwama attack in India saw an influx of misinformation on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. Doctored images and inflammatory messages circulated widely, escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. According to a study by the Oxford Internet Institute, the spread of such content is often amplified by automated bots and politically motivated actors who exploit social media algorithms to influence public opinion. The Algorithm dilemma At the heart of the problem lies the role of algorithms in shaping the digital narrative. Social media platforms prioritize content that generates engagement—likes, shares, and comments—often favoring sensational or polarizing material over factual reporting. This creates a dangerous feedback loop, where users are fed content that reinforces their biases, further deepening societal divides. A 2023 report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism highlighted this phenomenon, noting that 65% of Indian social media users frequently encountered politically charged content tailored to their preferences. During the 2022 floods in Pakistan, for instance, social media coverage varied drastically between regions, with some areas receiving overwhelming attention while others were largely ignored. Such disparities underscore how algorithms can inadvertently skew public focus. (Source) Empathy or echo chambers? One of the most profound effects of social media is its ability to humanize conflicts. Stories of resilience and survival from war-torn regions like Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Myanmar often evoke empathy among global audiences. Instagram, for example, has become a platform where photojournalists and activists share compelling visuals that capture the human cost of conflict. Yet, this potential for empathy is frequently undermined by echo chambers—digital spaces where users are exposed only to information that aligns with their existing beliefs. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center found that echo chambers significantly contribute to polarization, particularly during political or communal conflicts. In South Asia, this phenomenon has exacerbated divisions between religious and ethnic groups, as users are drawn deeper into ideologically homogenous circles. (Source) Social media as a catalyst for change—or chaos? Beyond its role in reporting, social media has proven to be a powerful tool for mobilization. In Pakistan, the #AuratMarch movement has relied heavily on platforms like Twitter and Instagram to organize rallies advocating for women’s rights. Similarly, during the Rohingya crisis, social media campaigns raised awareness about the atrocities committed against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, compelling global organizations to intervene. However, the same platforms that empower grassroots movements can also serve as tools for chaos. The 2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka and the 2020 Delhi riots in India were both fueled by incendiary posts on social media. These incidents illustrate how easily digital platforms can ignite real-world violence when left unchecked. To ensure that social media serves as a force for good in conflict reporting, concerted efforts are needed from all stakeholders. Social media platforms must prioritize robust content moderation, particularly in regional languages. Facebook, for instance, has faced criticism for its delayed response to harmful content in South Asian languages like Sinhalese and Bengali. Investing in local expertise and deploying AI-driven tools for real-time fact-checking are essential steps. Governments, too, have a role to play. Instead of resorting to blanket bans on social media, which often stifle legitimate voices, policymakers should focus on fostering media literacy and encouraging ethical practices in digital journalism. Initiatives like the ""Code of Conduct for Conflict-Sensitive Reporting,"" developed by Media Action Nepal in 2021, offer valuable frameworks for responsible reporting. Social media has indelibly transformed conflict reporting in South Asia, offering unparalleled opportunities to amplify marginalized voices and document human rights abuses. Yet, its role is fraught with challenges, from the spread of misinformation to the deepening of societal divides. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach—one that balances freedom of expression with accountability."

Dr Bakhshish Singh Sandhu, the President of Council of Khalistan and founding member of Sikhs For Justice, announced that the total votes cast were over 37,000.  The referendum was held in Auckland’s Aotea Square on Sunday, where thousands of Sikhs thronged to the venue to cast their votes, prompting the organizers to extend the voting time by one hour. Dr Bakhshish Singh Sandhu told thousands of supporters of Khalistan in his speech: “The Indian govt had lobbied against the voting and had asked New Zealand to ban Sikhs from taking part in the voting but the local authorities approved the referendum and clarified instead that New Zealand is a country committed to freedom of expression.  Throughout the day, thousands of Sikhs chanted slogans for the creation of Khalistan and accused the Indian govt of being involved in Sikh genocide and transnational oppression against Sikhs. They have shown how much love there is for Khalistan in the hearts of Sikhs.” After the Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) announced the event in New Zealand, the matter was raised by S Jaishankar, India's minister of external affairs, with NZ Foreign Minister Winston Peters during their meeting on the sidelines of the Raisina Down Under conference in Canberra on 6 November. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the Counsel General of SFJ, told the audience at the conclusion of the referendum that Sikhs had terrified the Indian state through peaceful voting process and the Hindutva state has resorted to terrorist means to punish Sikhs for seeking their homeland. “No other option is acceptable to Sikhs other than liberation from India. It’s either freedom or martyrdom.” The Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) chief announced a bounty of 1 million dollars for anyone who shares intelligence on Union Home Minister Amit Shah's foreign trips – and held him responsible for authorising the “terror campaign” against Sikhs. He said that Sikhs have decided to take on the Hindutva violent ideology by all means possible and the campaign to do so has started from Ayodhya, the birthplace of violent Hindutva ideology. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said: “Sikh Sangat in their thousands have cast their votes today to liberate Sikhs from the Indian occupation. This is a democratic way of seeking freedom but the terrorist Modi govt is trying to stop Sikhs through bullets and terrorism. Shaheed Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar was martyred in Canada inside the Gurdwara on orders of the Indian govt. “The principal is blood for blood and bullets for bullets and the Sikh Panth had shown their actions how it can avenge and execute for its rights – as seen in the assassination of Indira Gandhi – but today we are fighting India’s bullets with the ballots. We are working through non-violence and through our votes but this is a message for Amit Shah and Narendra Modi we have brought political death upon you through the weapon of ballot. We will hold each and every Indian leader accountable and bring them to justice through legal process. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun announced that the next phase of Khalistan Referendum will be held in the US state of Los Angeles. He ended the speech with the slogans of “Delhi banay ga Khalistan. Na Hindi, Na Hindutva, Na Hindustan, Delhi banay ga Khalistan. Khalistan Zindabad.”"

According to Israeli police, neither Netanyahu nor his family were home during the attack, and no injuries or property damage were reported. The incident, which took place amid heightened regional tensions, drew swift rebuke from Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Katz termed the attack a breach of “all red lines” and underscored the severity of threats faced by the Prime Minister from adversaries, including Iran and its regional proxies. Katz called on security and judicial authorities to take decisive action. Israeli President Isaac Herzog also condemned the attack, confirming that an investigation had been launched. “This act is unacceptable, and those responsible must be held accountable,” Herzog stated in his response on X. Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir added that the incident marked a dangerous escalation in hostility toward the Prime Minister. “Incitement against Netanyahu has already crossed dangerous thresholds, and throwing a flash bomb into his home represents a significant intensification of these threats,” he said. This attack comes just weeks after a drone was launched towards Netanyahu’s residence in October. That incident, like Saturday’s, caused no harm but highlighted growing security concerns surrounding the Prime Minister. Netanyahu’s Caesarea residence has seen heightened vigilance in recent months due to his pivotal role in Israel's domestic and international affairs, as well as ongoing political tensions. Saturday’s attack occurred against the backdrop of ongoing clashes in northern Israel. Israeli forces have been locked in intermittent skirmishes with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah since October 2023. Although no group has claimed responsibility for the latest attack, security experts are closely monitoring the situation for potential links to the northern conflict."

The missile, developed by India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in collaboration with industry partners, was launched from the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the eastern coast of Odisha on Saturday. The successful test marks a significant milestone in India’s military development, with the missile achieving its final maneuvers and striking the target with remarkable accuracy, as confirmed by data from ships stationed downrange. Designed to carry a variety of payloads, the missile can cover distances exceeding 1,500 kilometers, offering the Indian Armed Forces a formidable addition to their arsenal. This breakthrough has the potential to significantly alter the regional balance of power, particularly in light of its implications for neighboring countries like Pakistan and China, which are closely monitoring the developments. India’s Defense Minister, Rajnath Singh, hailed the test as a ""historic achievement,"" emphasising that it places India among a select group of nations with such advanced military technologies.""The successful test reinforces India’s growing prowess in defense technology,"" Singh said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He also congratulated DRDO, the Armed Forces, and industry partners for their role in the success. The missile’s development is a product of years of research, with contributions from the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex in Hyderabad, as well as other DRDO labs. Senior DRDO scientists and Armed Forces officers were present during the flight test, underscoring the collaboration between India’s defense establishment and scientific community. The successful test places India alongside global powers such as the United States, Russia, and China, who are all pursuing the development of hypersonic weapons. The global race for hypersonic technology has become increasingly vital, as these weapons are considered highly effective in countering modern defense systems due to their speed and maneuverability. Experts say that the missile’s range and precision make it a significant strategic asset, particularly as tensions in the region remain high. With its successful test, India has demonstrated its growing defense capabilities, which could have lasting implications for its security posture and its relationships with neighboring countries."

Xi’s comments came during a meeting with outgoing US President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru. The meeting, held at Xi’s hotel in Lima, was overshadowed by concerns of escalating tensions as Trump prepares to assume office in January with a team known for its strong stance on China. ""China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation, and manage differences to strive for a smooth transition of the China-US relationship,"" Xi stated in translated remarks. The Biden-Xi meeting addressed a range of sensitive issues, including trade disputes, Taiwan, and Beijing’s support for Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Biden emphasized the need for stability, remarking, ""Our two countries cannot let competition veer into conflict. Over the last four years, I believe we have proven this relationship can be managed constructively."" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan later noted that Biden stressed the importance of maintaining stability during the transition period, adding that the outgoing president was not a “conduit” for any backchannel messages to Trump. The meeting also touched upon Biden’s concerns over China’s support for Russia's defense sector and North Korea’s deployment of troops to aid Moscow. The White House readout highlighted Biden’s “deep concern” regarding these developments, which are perceived as fueling global instability. The specter of Trump’s return to the White House loomed large over the discussions. Trump’s previous administration engaged in a bruising trade war with China, imposing tariffs that Beijing retaliated against. During his campaign, Trump threatened new tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese imports, signaling a potentially confrontational approach. Xi, in pointed remarks during the APEC summit, urged the US to foster global stability, saying, “China and the United States should inject more certainty and positive energy into the turbulent world.” Climate change emerged as another pressing issue as Biden prepares to attend the G20 summit in Brazil next week. The outgoing president has championed international climate accords, but Trump’s promises to withdraw from such agreements have heightened global concerns. Biden, who is set to visit the Amazon rainforest during his stop in Manaus, Brazil, ahead of the G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro, aims to highlight his administration's commitment to combating climate change. The Biden-Xi meeting followed a two-day summit of the 21-member APEC group, which included leaders from Japan, Canada, Singapore, and Australia. Russia was represented by a deputy prime minister, underscoring its reduced engagement on the global stage amid the Ukraine conflict."

Araqchi also warned that Iran was ""prepared for confrontation or cooperation"" in its dispute with the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA and Western countries within the body over its nuclear programme. ""This (reported meeting) was a fabricated story by American media, and the motives behind this can also be speculated,"" Araqchi said, reiterating an earlier denial by Iran's Foreign Ministry. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Musk, who is an adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, met with Iran's ambassador to the United Nations on Monday. ""In my opinion, the American media’s fabrication about a meeting between Elon Musk and Iran’s representative is a form of testing the waters to see if the ground for such move exists,"" Araqchi said. ""We are still waiting for the new U.S. administration to clarify its policies, and based on that, we will adjust our own policies. Right now, it is neither the time for such meetings nor is it appropriate,"" Araqchi said. ""There was no permission from the leadership for such a meeting,"" Araqchi said, referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters of state. Relations between Tehran and the IAEA have soured over several long-standing issues, including Iran barring the agency's uranium-enrichment experts from the country and its failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. ""Our nuclear path in the coming year will be sensitive and complex, and we are prepared for confrontation or cooperation,"" Araqchi said. He said that the 2015 nuclear deal, from which Trump exited in 2018 in his first term, no longer holds the same value for Iran. ""If negotiations begin, the nuclear pact may serve as a reference, but it no longer has its previous significance. We must reach a feasible agreement,"" Araqchi said."

U.S authorities said Adani and seven other defendants, including his nephew Sagar Adani, agreed to pay the bribes to Indian government officials to obtain contracts expected to yield $2 billion of profit over 20 years, and develop India's largest solar power plant project. A judge has issued arrest warrants for Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani and prosecutors plan to hand those warrants to foreign law enforcement, court records show. Prosecutors also said the Adanis and another executive at Adani Green Energy, former CEO Vneet Jaain, raised more than $3 billion in loans and bonds by hiding their corruption from lenders and investors. Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Jaain were charged with securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, and the Adanis were also charged in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case. Fallout for the Adani empire, which was rocked by a short-seller attack in February 2023, was immediate with shares in conglomerate's listed companies stocks tumbling between 10% and 20%. Adani Green Energy also cancelled plans on Thursday to raise $600 million in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. The bond had been priced but was pulled following the news. Adani dollar bonds slumped in Asian trading, with prices down between 3-5c on bonds for Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone . The falls were the largest since the Adani Group came under a short-seller attack in February 2023. According to an indictment, some conspirators referred privately to Gautam Adani with the code names ""Numero uno"" and ""the big man,"" while Sagar Adani allegedly used his cellphone to track specifics about the bribes. The Adani Group has not responded to requests for comment. Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Jaain were charged with securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, and the Adanis were also charged in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case. Five other defendants were charged with conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. anti-bribery law, and four were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice. None of the defendants is in custody, a spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Breon Peace in Brooklyn said. Gautam Adani is believed to be in India. Shares in GQG Partners , an Australia-listed investment firm that is a major Adani backer, slid 20%. The decline was the stock's largest one-day fall since it listed three years ago. GQG last year bought 3.4% of Adani Enterprises - the group's flagship firm, 4.1% of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, 2.5% of Adani Transmission and 3.5% of Adani Green Energy. It said in a statement that it was monitoring the charges. Gautam Adani, 62, is worth $69.8 billion according to Forbes magazine. He is one of the few billionaires formally accused in the United States of criminal wrongdoing."

However, there is no official confirmation yet. Sources indicate that Bishnoi, who allegedly coordinated gang activities alongside Goldy Brar from the US, was detained approximately four to five days ago. His last known location was Fresno, California, but it remains unclear if the detention occurred there. Efforts are underway to gather further details through official channels. This marks the second significant detention of a wanted gangster in recent weeks, following Arshdeep Singh Gill, alias Arsh Dalla’s, detention in Canada last month. US authorities were reportedly in contact with Mumbai Police regarding Bishnoi’s whereabouts. Mumbai Police are investigating his alleged involvement in two high-profile cases: a firing incident outside actor Salman Khan’s residence on April 14 and the killing of NCP leader Baba Siddique in Bandra East on October 12. Officials are preparing an extradition request for Bishnoi. Bishnoi has been listed as ‘most wanted’ by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), with a million INR reward for his capture. The NIA alleges that Bishnoi and Brar oversee the Lawrence Bishnoi gang’s operations from abroad, managing extortion rackets, killings, and connections with pro-Khalistan groups such as Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The Lawrence Bishnoi gang, active in multiple Indian states, has links with singers, industrialists, political figures, and the film industry, often targeting them for extortion. This nexus has drawn parallels to Mumbai’s underworld before the 1993 blasts. Anmol Bishnoi is also suspected of involvement in the murder of singer Sidhu Moosewala in May 2022. Authorities continue to investigate the extensive criminal network led by the gang’s overseas operatives."

""From tomorrow, physical classes shall be suspended for Class 10 and 12 as well, and all studies will be shifted online,"" Delhi Chief Minister Atishi posted on X. The decision followed the Supreme Court's directive to Delhi and NCR states to decide on online classes for all students and report back by Friday. Delhi's air quality deteriorated to hazardous levels, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 494, leaving residents struggling with breathing difficulties, itchy eyes, and sore throats. Doctors warned that the toxic air poses risks to both vulnerable groups and healthy individuals. The Supreme Court criticized the authorities in Delhi and NCR for delays in implementing Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which includes stricter anti-pollution measures. The court emphasized that restrictions under Stage 4 would remain in effect even if the AQI drops below 450. A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih questioned the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on its delayed response. “It is because of your fault that we are facing this situation today. In such a serious case, how do you wait for three days?” the court asked. “Till further orders are passed by this court, implementation of GRAP Stage 4 will continue even if AQI falls below 450,"" it added.

"482","International","Taliban suspends polio vaccination campaign in Afghanistan","https://www.samaa.tv/2087321643-taliban-suspends-polio-vaccination-campaign-in-afghanistan","The Taliban administration in Afghanistan has suspended the door-to-door polio vaccination campaign, raising alarm among health officials and international organizations. The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed serious concerns over this decision, warning of potential consequences for public health. According to WHO reports, Afghanistan has confirmed 18 polio cases this year, marking a 6% increase compared to 2023. This surge in cases highlights the ongoing challenge of eradicating the disease in the country. The United Nations has described the suspension of the vaccination drive as a ""devastating setback."" Health experts worry that this decision could have far-reaching implications, not only for Afghanistan but also for neighboring countries. Pakistan, which shares a border with Afghanistan, has already faced challenges due to the spread of the poliovirus through Afghan refugees. This interconnected health risk underscores the importance of coordinated efforts in the region to combat the disease. The Taliban's decision comes at a time when global health initiatives are focused on the complete eradication of polio. The suspension of the vaccination campaign in Afghanistan could potentially hinder these worldwide efforts. International health organizations and human rights groups are calling for immediate action to address this situation. They emphasize the critical need to resume vaccination efforts to protect children from this debilitating disease. The polio vaccination campaign's suspension is seen as part of broader challenges facing Afghanistan's healthcare system since the Taliban took control. As the situation develops, health officials continue to monitor the impact on public health in the country and the surrounding region."

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reports that this action is part of a broader crackdown on media freedom in the country. On September 5, Taliban authorities reportedly shut down the terrestrial signal for Afghan International. This followed a statement on September 4 by Taliban Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Stanekzai, who labeled the channel an ""enemy"" after it reported on alleged misuse of flood aid in the northern Baghlan province. The CPJ has expressed alarm over the situation, stating that journalists in Afghanistan face ""severe dangers"" under Taliban rule. The organization also noted that in May, Taliban officials had ordered both journalists and civilians to boycott Afghan International. These recent developments are part of a pattern of media restrictions since the Taliban's return to power. The CPJ warns that any independent media outlet committed to providing accurate information now faces threats from the authorities. The actions against Afghan International and other press outlets have raised concerns about access to information and freedom of expression in Afghanistan. International observers continue to monitor the situation as it unfolds."

Netanyahu’s critics accused him of putting politics ahead of national security at a time when Israel is bracing for Iranian retaliation to its [USN:L1N3M60ET TEXT:“Oct. 26 airstrikes”] on the Islamic Republic. After Gallant was fired, protesters in Israel blocked highways and lit bonfires on roads, police said. The prime minister named Gideon Saar as the new foreign minister in place of Katz. Gallant and Netanyahu, both in the right-wing Likud party, have [USN:L1N3MC0YJ TEXT:“clashed for months”] over the objectives of Israel’s 13-month-old war in Gaza against Palestinian militant group Hamas. But the timing of Gallant’s dismissal was a surprise, and came as Israel’s ally the U.S. held its presidential election. Israel’s campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon have entered new phases following the killing of top commanders in both Hamas and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Netanyahu said Gallant has made statements that “contradict the decisions of the government and the decisions of the cabinet”. In response, Gallant said: “The security of the state of Israel always was and will always remain my life’s mission.” Katz vowed the return of Israel’s hostages from Gaza and destruction of Hamas and Hezbollah. “I accept this responsibility with a sense of mission and holy fear for the security of the State of Israel and its citizens,” Katz said on social media platform X. Gayil Talshir, a specialist in Israeli politics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, believed the last straw for Netanyahu came this week when Gallant issued 7,000 draft notices for ultra-Orthodox Haredi men, angering those in the government who oppose conscription. Itamar Ben-Gvir, a minister in Netanyahu’s coalition government, praised Tuesday’s decision, saying Gallant was “deeply trapped in the conception” that it “is not possible to achieve absolute victory”. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said on X, however, that “firing Gallant in the middle of a war is an act of madness.” In Washington, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said Gallant had been an important partner and that it would continue working collaboratively with Katz. Gallant rose to the rank of general during a 35-year military career. France’s foreign minister will travel to Israel and the Palestinian territories on Wednesday, a day after U.S. elections, to press Israel to engage diplomatically to end the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. NORTHERN GAZA AIRSTRIKES Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli forces issued new evacuation orders in the northern Gaza Strip and carried out military strikes which Palestinian medics and media said had killed at least 35 people since Monday night. Acting U.N. aid chief Joyce Msuya said on X that Israeli military ground operations in northern Gaza had left Palestinians “without the essentials to survive, forced them to flee for safety multiple times, and cut off their escape and supply routes.” An airstrike late on Monday damaged two houses in the town of Beit Lahiya, killing at least 20 people, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA and Hamas media said. Ten were killed in central areas of the Palestinian enclave - six in separate airstrikes on Gaza City and the town of Deir Al-Balah, and four in the town of Al-Zawayda around midnight on Monday, medics and health officials said. At least five others were killed in an Israeli strike on a house in Jabalia north of Gaza City, medics said later on Tuesday. The Israeli military said, without giving details, that its forces had “eliminated terrorists” in the central Gaza Strip and Jabalia area. Israeli troops had also located weapons and explosives over the past day in the southern Rafah area, where “terrorist infrastructure sites” had been eliminated, it said. Later on Tuesday, Israeli planes dropped leaflets over Beit Lahiya ordering residents who have not yet left their homes and shelters housing displaced families to quit the town completely. “To all those who remained at homes and shelters, you are risking your lives. For your safety you have to head south,” said the leaflet, which was written in Arabic. Palestinians said the new attacks and Israeli orders for evacuations were aimed at emptying areas to create buffer zones. Israel says the evacuations are meant to keep civilians out of harm’s way as its troops battle Hamas fighters. More than 43,300 Palestinians have been killed in more than a year of war in Gaza, health authorities in Gaza say. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies."

According to the new guidelines, entrance to medical and engineering programs will now prioritize students’ grades in science subjects rather than their overall percentage scores. This change allows universities greater flexibility in setting admission requirements, providing students with diverse academic pathways. The Ministry of Education emphasized that these changes are designed to streamline students' transition to higher education, supporting their academic and career aspirations. Universities will also be permitted to admit students who may not meet English proficiency standards by enrolling them in qualifying courses to reach the required language level. Additionally, students who do not meet specific subject requirements for their chosen specialization can enroll in remedial courses. In line with the EmSAT cancellation, admissions for medical and engineering fields will now place more focus on relevant scientific subject grades rather than the Grade 12 overall percentage. The ministry encouraged students and parents to review each university’s admission requirements, specific to the student’s desired academic program. The Ministry of Education also updated certificate equivalency rules for private schools, now requiring academic records from the last three years. Furthermore, all Arab students must study Arabic, and Muslim students must study Islamic Studies for the same period, reflecting the UAE’s focus on promoting the Arabic language and fostering values of religious tolerance. Sarah Al Amiri, the UAE Minister of Education, stated, ""The flexibility of our educational policies stems from our absolute concern for the interests of our students."" Dr. Abdul Rahman Al Awar, Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation and Acting Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, highlighted that the new approach aims to enhance access to higher education for all Grade 12 graduates, whether they pursue bachelor's, diploma, or skill certification programs. The Emirates Standardized Test (EmSAT) is a skill assessment tool used across various educational levels. Previously required for university admissions and scholarships, EmSAT was made optional in 2023, with universities allowed to consider other tests for admissions. EmSAT also assisted students in identifying their educational pathways and gauged their readiness for higher education. Grade 12 students could register for EmSAT using UAE PASS, with a free first attempt for UAE nationals in four key subjects (English, Arabic, Math, and Physics) and subsequent subjects costing Dh100 each. Non-UAE nationals paid Dh300 for the mandatory subjects, with a Dh100 fee per additional subject."

Initially launched on September 1 and scheduled to end on October 31, the amnesty scheme has allowed thousands of residents to regularize their visa status, with authorities waiving millions in fines for overstayers. This extension coincides with the UAE's 53rd Union Day celebrations, highlighting the country's humanitarian and civilised values. ICP Director General Maj-Gen Suhail Saeed Al Khaili emphasized that the decision reflects the UAE’s commitment to assist individuals wishing to settle their residency status. He stated that the extension provides ""the last chance for violators to regularize their status without incurring fines or facing re-entry bans."" Al Khaili noted a significant increase in applications as the original deadline approached, urging violators to take advantage of this extended period. He cautioned, however, that fines would be reinstated for those who continue to overstay beyond the new deadline. He also highlighted ICP’s plan to intensify inspections on violators post-deadline. This is the UAE’s fourth amnesty programme since 2007, with the last one in 2018 similarly extended to allow more residents to regularize their status. Overstayers can apply for amnesty at ICP centres, approved typing centres, or via online channels throughout the UAE. "

The picture showing Carbonell with her mother, her late father and her sister from decades back was the only family photo in the house to survive the deluge, the worst floods in Spain's modern history. Given the state of the print, there is a risk that memento could also disappear. So she joined scores of survivors turning up to see if experts from a project run by the University of Valencia could do anything to save their memories. ""It's the only keepsake my mother can have because my father passed away when he was 36, and my mother is now 74,"" said Carbonell, at one of the collection points set up by the new ""Save the Pictures"" scheme. ""Furniture and cars can be replaced... (Pictures) are material things but they reach an incalculable sentimental level,"" the 44-year-old added. The scheme aims to restore and safeguard damaged photographic heritage and return it to flood-hit communities. One of the main challenges is the fact that so many of the photos are stuck together, said Marisa Vazquez de Agredos, head of the university's heritage department. More than 220 people died after torrential rains on Oct. 29 triggered the flash floods that ravaged the suburbs of Valencia. The waters also caused untold damage to buildings and property, and to the countless photos and other mementoes that make up family history. Some like Carbonell brought in single shots. Pilar Jimenez turned up with her whole family archive, with so much material that a soldier working on the clean-up effort had to use a wheelbarrow to help her bring it in. ""I bring my whole life - my daughters when they were little, my wedding, I don't know, everything,"" said the 65-year-old from Valencia's suburb of Aldaia. She told staff to make a selection, rather than take the time to save everything. ""My father was very fond of photography, so I also have many photos of myself as a child. So it's a lot."""

In his opening remarks, Shehbaz welcomed participants and underscored the severe impact of climate change on developing countries, which often lack the resources to combat environmental threats effectively. Drawing from Pakistan’s experience with devastating floods in recent years, he emphasized that Pakistan understands the critical climate challenges faced by other developing countries. The PM called on the global community to adhere to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principles. He stressed that achieving meaningful results requires commitment from developed nations to provide necessary support, especially by establishing specialized climate funds.  According to Shehbaz, developing countries will need approximately $6.8 trillion by 2030 to mitigate and adapt to climate change. He urged developed nations to actively assist in promoting eco-friendly energy sources, which could offer sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels and benefit vulnerable economies. He further emphasized that addressing the climate crisis is a shared responsibility and requires a strong partnership between developed and developing countries. The conference, hosted by Pakistan, served as a platform for representatives of developing nations to voice their financial and environmental concerns, appealing for greater cooperation to meet ambitious climate targets. Earlier, Shehbaz Sharif joined world leaders at the COP29 Summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, where environmental challenges and climate change solutions are at the forefront.

"492","International","Trump asks Putin to avoid Ukraine war escalation","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323829-trump-asks-putin-to-avoid-ukraine-war-escalation","US President-elect Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and advised him not to escalate the Ukraine war, a source familiar with the conversation told Reuters on Sunday, as President Joe Biden plans to urge Trump not to abandon Kyiv. Trump and Putin spoke in recent days, said the source. Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday. Trump has criticised the scale of US military and financial support for Kyiv, vowing to end the war quickly, without saying how. Ukraine's foreign ministry said it was not informed in advance of the call between Trump and Putin and subsequently could neither endorse or object to it. ""We do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders,"" said Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, when asked about the phone call, which was first reported by The Washington Post. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Republican Trump will take office on Jan 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov 5 presidential election. Biden has invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Biden's top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what's happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East. ""President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,"" Sullivan told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" show. Sullivan's comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war. When asked if Biden would ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred. ""I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term,"" Sullivan said. Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of US military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February of 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticised and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers. Trump insisted last year that Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the time. He told Reuters Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject and Biden has never suggested. Zelenskiy said on Thursday he was not aware of any details of Trump's plan to end the Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail major concessions for Kyiv. According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take control of the US Senate with a 52-seat majority. Control of the US House of Representatives in the next Congress is not yet clear with some votes still being counted. Republicans have won 213 seats, according to Edison Research, just shy of the 218 needed for a majority. If Republicans win both chambers, it will mean the majority of Trump's agenda will have a significantly easier time passing through Congress. Republican US Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state, criticised US funding for Ukraine in a CBS interview. ""The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation,"" Hagerty said. The 2.5-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war. Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war. Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies."

Demonstrators gathered in Valencia and other cities, voicing their outrage at what they called inadequate warnings and a delayed response to the flash floods that impacted around 80 towns and cities. In Valencia, where protesters marched to city hall, chants of “Murderers!” echoed through the streets as citizens held placards criticizing Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Valencia’s Regional President Carlos Mazon. Tensions ran high, with scuffles reported between police and demonstrators.  Citizens expressed frustration over the lack of timely alerts, some noting that warnings arrived on their phones only after the floods had already begun. Julian Garcia, a 75-year-old protester, argued that earlier alerts could have saved lives by encouraging residents to avoid traveling to work or sending children to school. The clean-up in Valencia continues, as authorities search for missing persons. Many protesters demanded accountability, with some accusing leaders of mismanagement amounting to manslaughter. Ana de la Rosa, a demonstrator, condemned the political infighting between regional and national leaders, calling for more than resignations and demanding systemic accountability. As the region battles post-flood challenges, health officials have also called on local governments to implement measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. "
"494","International","Germany faces snap election as Scholz's coalition crumbles","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323635-germany-faces-snap-election-as-scholz-s-coalition-crumbles","Germany's ruling coalition collapsed on Wednesday as Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked his finance minister and paved the way for a snap election, triggering political chaos in Europe's largest economy hours after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. After sacking Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats (FDP) party, Scholz is expected to head a minority government with his Social Democrats and the Greens, the second-largest party. He would have to rely on cobbled-together parliamentary majorities to pass legislation and he plans to hold a parliamentary confidence vote in his government on Jan 15, which could trigger snap elections by the end of March. Scholz said he would ask Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition conservatives who are far ahead in polls, for support in passing the budget and boosting military spending. Merz is due to respond in a Thursday morning news conference. The collapse of Scholz's three-way alliance caps months of wrangling over budget policy and Germany's economic direction, with the government's popularity sinking and far-right and far-left forces surging. ""We need a government that is able to act, that has the strength to make the necessary decisions for our country,"" Scholz told reporters. Scholz said he fired Lindner for his obstructive behaviour on budget disputes, accusing the minister of putting party before country and blocking legislation on spurious grounds. The move comes a day after the election of Republican Donald Trump as US president, with Europe scrambling to form a united response on issues from possible new U.S. tariffs to Russia's war in Ukraine and the future of the NATO alliance. The government crisis comes at a critical juncture for Germany, with a flatlining economy, aging infrastructure and an unprepared military. A political shake-up could fuel growing frustration with Germany's mainstream parties to the benefit of younger populist movements, including the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD). With France also facing political uncertainty after snap elections this year, turmoil in the European Union's two largest economies could hamper efforts to deepen the bloc's integration at a time when it is facing challenges from east and west. The coalition has been at odds over how best to rescue Europe's largest economy, which is facing its second year of contraction and a crisis in its economic model after the end of cheap gas from Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine and amid increasing competition from China. Scholz said he had proposed capping energy costs for companies to bolster Germany's appeal as a place to do business. He wanted a package to help save jobs in the ailing auto industry, as well as increased support for Ukraine. The FDP had proposed public spending cuts, lower taxes and less regulation as the answer to the malaise. It also wants to slow Germany's shift to a carbon-neutral economy. Speaking after Scholz, Lindner said the chancellor had tried to strong-arm him into breaking a constitutionally-enshrined spending limit known as the debt brake, a move that Lindner, a fiscal hawk, refused to support. Government sources said Scholz had wanted to increase a Ukraine support package by 3 billion euros ($3.22 billion) to 15 billion euros and to finance it by suspending the debt brake. ""Olaf Scholz refuses to recognise that our country needs a new economic model,"" Lindner told reporters. ""Olaf Scholz has showed he doesn't have the strength to give his country a new boost."" The SPD and the Greens, while at odds on some issues, agree that targeted government spending is needed. The three other FDP ministers - for transport, justice, and education - all voluntarily left the government. Scholz said Lindner was focused on the short-term survival of his own party. ""Especially today, one day after such an important event as the US elections, this kind of selfishness is utterly incomprehensible."" Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens said the coalition could not agree on how to plug a funding gap in the budget for next year. ""I want to say on our behalf that tonight feels wrong and doesn’t feel right. It’s almost tragic on a day like today, when Germany needs to show unity and capacity for action in Europe."""

Muslim support for Trump helped him win Michigan and may have factored into other swing state wins, strategists believe. Trump picked Republican senator, Marco Rubio, a staunch supporter of Israel for Secretary of State. Rubio said earlier this year he would not call for a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he believed Israel should destroy “every element” of Hamas. “These people are vicious animals,” he added. Trump also nominated Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas Governor and staunch pro-Israel conservative who backs Israeli occupation of the West Bank and has called a two-state solution in Palestine “unworkable”, as the next ambassador to Israel. He has picked Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, who called the UN a “cesspool of anti-Semitism” for its condemnation of deaths in Gaza, to serve as US ambassador to the United Nations. Rexhinaldo Nazarko, executive director of the American Muslim Engagement and Empowerment Network (AMEEN), said Muslim voters had hoped Trump would choose Cabinet officials who work toward peace, and there was no sign of that. “We are very disappointed,” he said. “It seems like this administration has been packed entirely with neoconservatives and extremely pro-Israel, pro-war people, which is a failure on the of President Trump, to the pro-peace and anti-war movement.” Nazarko said the community would continue pressing to make its voices heard after rallying votes to help Trump win. “At least we’re on the map.” Hassan Abdel Salam, a former professor at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and co-founder of the “Abandon Harris” campaign, which endorsed Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, said Trump’s staffing plans were not surprising, but had proven even more extreme that he had feared. “It’s like he’s going on Zionist overdrive,” he said. “We were always extremely sceptical […] Obviously we’re still waiting to see where the administration will go, but it does look like our community has been played.” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Several Muslim and Arab supporters of Trump said they hoped Richard Grenell, Trump’s former acting Director of National Intelligence, would play a key role after he led months of outreach to Muslim and Arab American communities, and was even introduced as a potential next Secretary of State at events. Another key Trump ally, Massad Boulos, the Lebanese father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Tiffany, met repeatedly with Arab-American and Muslim leaders. Both promised Arab-American and Muslim voters that Trump was a candidate for peace who would act swiftly to end the wars in the Middle East and beyond. Neither was immediately reachable. Trump made several visits to cities with large Arab-American and Muslim populations, including a stop in Dearborn, a majority Arab city, where he said he loved Muslims, and Pittsburgh, where he called Muslims for Trump “a beautiful movement. They want peace. They want stability.” Rola Makki, the Lebanese-American, Muslim Vice Chair for Outreach of the Michigan Republican Party, shrugged off the criticism. “I don’t think everyone’s going to be happy with every appointment Trump makes, but the outcome is what matters,” she said. “I do know that Trump wants peace, and what people need to realise is that there’s 50,000 dead Palestinians and 3,000 dead Lebanese, and that’s happened during the current administration.”"

Trump’s nomination of Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who lacks deep intelligence experience and is seen as soft on Russia and Syria, is among several high-level picks that suggest he may be prioritizing personal allegiance over competence as he assembles his second-term team. Among the risks, say current and former intelligence officials and independent experts, are that top advisers could feed the incoming Republican president a distorted view of global threats based on what they believe will please him and that foreign allies may be reluctant to share vital information.  Randal Phillips, a former CIA operations directorate official who worked as the agency's top representative in China, said that with Trump loyalists in top government posts, “this could become the avenue of choice for some really questionable actions” by the leadership of the intelligence community. A Western security source said there could be an initial slowdown in intelligence sharing when Trump takes office in January that could potentially impact the “Five Eyes,” an intelligence alliance comprising the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The worry from U.S. allies is that Trump’s appointments all lean in the “wrong direction”, the source said. Trump's presidential transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Inside and outside the U.S. intelligence network, much of the anxiety focuses on Trump’s choice of Gabbard, 43, as director of national intelligence, especially given her views seen as sympathetic to Russia in its war against Ukraine. While Trump has made some conventional personnel decisions such as that of Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, Wednesday’s announcement of Gabbard, an officer in the U.S. Army Reserves, surprised even some Republican insiders. She is likely to face tough questioning in her Senate confirmation hearings. Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, has stirred controversy over her criticism of President Joe Biden’s support for Ukraine, which has prompted some critics to accuse her of parroting Kremlin propaganda. She also spoke out against U.S. military intervention in the civil war in Syria under former President Barack Obama and met in 2017 with Moscow-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with whom Washington severed all diplomatic ties in 2012. The selection of Gabbard has raised alarm in the ranks of intelligence officers unsure of how tightly she holds some of her geopolitical views, whether she is misinformed or simply echoing Trump’s “Make America Great Again” followers, one intelligence official said on condition of anonymity. “Of course there's going to be resistance to change from the ‘swamp’ in Washington,” Gabbard said in a Fox News interview on Wednesday night. She said voters had given Trump “an incredible mandate” to move away from Biden’s agenda but offered no policy specifics. ALLIES ATTENTIVE A senior European intelligence official said agencies in European Union countries “will be pragmatic and ready to adapt to the changes.” “No panic in the air for now,” the official added. A European defense official described Gabbard as “firmly"" in the Russia camp. ""But we have to deal with what we have. We will be attentive,” the official said. Some analysts said concerns about Gabbard could be tempered by Trump’s choice to head the CIA: John Ratcliffe, a former congressman who served as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump’s first term. Though close to Trump and expected to offer little pushback against his policies, Ratcliffe is not seen as an incendiary figure and could act as a counterbalance to Gabbard in his post atop the No. 1 spy agency among the 18 that she would oversee. But some analysts said that by attempting to install Gabbard with other controversial loyalists, including congressman Matt Gaetz for attorney general and Fox commentator and military veteran Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, Trump is showing he wants no guardrails to his efforts to remake federal institutions. Democratic critics were quick to pounce not only on Gabbard’s views but what they see as her lack of qualifications and the potential the new administration could deploy intelligence for political ends. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept 11, 2001 attacks to fix what was seen as a lack of coordination between those organizations. “She isn’t being put in this job to do the job or to be good at it. She’s being put there to serve Donald Trump’s interests,” U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN on Thursday. SUPPORT FOR ISOLATIONIST POLICIES After leaving the Democratic Party, Gabbard became increasingly critical of Biden and grew popular among conservatives, often appearing on far-right TV and radio shows, where she became known for supporting isolationist policies and showing disdain for ""wokeness."" Shortly after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Gabbard wrote in a social media post: “This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO."" Rubio, a former Trump rival turned supporter, defended Gabbard’s nomination, describing her as a “revolutionary pick that has a chance to really make a positive change.” But some other Republicans were more non-committal. Asked about Gabbard's qualifications, Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Intelligence Committee, said: ""We're going to do our job, vet the nominees and make a decision. That's a constitutional responsibility of the Senate.” To become director of national intelligence, Gabbard must first be confirmed by a majority of the 100-member U.S. Senate, where she could face headwinds. Trump's fellow Republicans will have at least a 52-48 seat majority in the chamber starting in January, and have in the past been eager to back the party leader, increasing the likelihood that she will secure the post. “Our friends are watching as closely as our foes, and they are asking what this all means for the pre-eminent player in global intelligence collection and analysis,” said one former U.S. intelligence officer who worked in some of the world’s hotspots."

During his weekly press briefing on Thursday, when asked about India's alleged decision not to visit Pakistan for next year's ICC Champions Trophy, Patel stressed that India and Pakistan could themselves talk about their bilateral relationship. Speaking on US support for sports diplomacy, Patel said, ""Sports is certainly a potent and connecting force ...this department really [prioritises] the role that sports diplomacy has in connecting people."" He further commented that sports connected many people, and was a great way for ""human-to-human and people-to-people ties that this administration has really prioritised"". Patel also addressed the Nov 9 terrorist attack in Balochistan. He condemned the ""BLA Majeed Brigade’s November 9th bombing at a railway station"" and extended condolences to the victims' families, reaffirming Pakistan and United States’ shared interest in combating such threats. “We have a shared commitment to regional security... we’re going to continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism and violent extremism,” Patel remarked.

With 218 seats secured following a victory in Arizona, President-elect Donald Trump and his party now hold both legislative chambers, setting the stage for an aggressive push to implement their ""America First"" agenda once Trump takes office in January. The GOP win in the House reinforces Trump's ability to pursue sweeping changes to the federal government, including plans for a large-scale deportation initiative, tax cuts, and expanded executive powers. Republican leaders, emboldened by this majority, envision a strong mandate, with House Speaker Mike Johnson signaling plans to overhaul government programs and regulations, even those popular among Democrats. Johnson, who secured Trump’s endorsement to stay on as speaker, described a vision to reshape the federal government and implement an ambitious 100-day agenda alongside Trump. “Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,” Johnson said earlier this week. “The American people want us to implement and deliver that ‘America First’ agenda.” Trump has already made strategic appointments, including nominating Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, though the choice has stirred debate among Republican senators. Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has signaled that Republicans intend to investigate past legal probes against Trump, including those led by Special Counsel Jack Smith. Despite the victory, the GOP faces challenges in managing its narrow House majority. Gaetz's recent resignation, along with potential additional vacancies due to Trump’s administration picks, could complicate early legislative efforts. Republicans also need to manage factions within the party, as hardline conservatives are ascendant and looking to capitalize on Trump’s win. Senate Republicans are also unifying under new leadership, with Sen. John Thune of South Dakota taking over as Senate Majority Leader following the retirement of Sen. Mitch McConnell. Thune, previously critical of Trump, pledged unity in advancing Trump’s agenda and securing Cabinet appointments. Amid these shifts, Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are strategizing to maintain relevance in the legislative process as they assess their election losses. However, with Republicans firmly in control of Congress, Democrats face an uphill battle in opposing Trump’s transformative agenda. As the new Congress prepares to convene on January 3, Trump's influence over the GOP is expected to shape the future direction of the federal government, ushering in a period of dramatic policy shifts and heightened partisan tensions in Washington."
"499","International","Trump taps loyalists with few qualifications for top jobs","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323964-trump-taps-loyalists-with-few-qualifications-for-top-jobs","US President-elect Donald Trump chose loyalists with little experience for several key cabinet positions on Wednesday, stunning some allies and making clear that he is serious about reshaping - and in some cases testing - America's institutions. Trump's choice of congressman Matt Gaetz, 42, for US attorney general, America's top law enforcement officer, was a surprising pick. The former attorney has never worked in the Justice Department, or as a prosecutor, and was investigated by the Justice Department over sex trafficking allegations. His office said in 2023 that he had been told by prosecutors he would not face criminal charges. Trump tapped Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. The former Democratic congresswoman-turned-Trump-ally has in the past spoken out against military intervention in the civil war in Syria under former President Barack Obama and implied that Russian President Vladimir Putin had valid grounds for invading Ukraine, America's ally. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength,"" Trump said in a statement. Gabbard has little direct experience with intelligence work and had not been widely expected to be tapped for the post, which oversees 18 spy agencies. She was deployed in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 as a major in the Hawaii National Guard and is now a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Reserves. On Tuesday, Trump chose Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and veteran, to be his secretary of defence. Hegseth has opposed women in combat roles and questioned whether the top American general was promoted to his position because of his skin colour. He also lobbied Trump during his 2017-2021 term to pardon service members who allegedly committed war crimes. Sprinkled in with those personnel choices were more conventional selections. Trump said on Wednesday he would nominate Senator Marco Rubio, who is a hardliner on China, as his new secretary of state. Also Read: Trump's team drawing up list of Pentagon officers to fire But on the whole, his selections signal a radical shift in the way the US government conducts its business and in the role America will play in the world over the next four years. Trump has said he wants to end the “weaponization” of the Justice Department, which he said brought politically motivated criminal cases against him to hurt his presidential candidacy. The department says it acts without political bias. One common thread for Trump's picks: He chose unfailingly loyal people who are unlikely to push back against his most controversial orders, analysts said. Trump pledged on the campaign trail to go after his political enemies, including Democratic President Joe Biden, a pledge that Gaetz, his attorney general-designate, is unlikely to stand in the way of. ""Gaetz will do exactly as Trump says, which is why he was picked I guess,"" said a source close to Trump, after Gaetz's selection as was announced. A half dozen sources close to Trump world, including donors, consultants and fundraisers, said privately that they were shocked by the choice of Gaetz because of his limited qualifications and past DOJ investigation into him. ""I was shocked that he has been nominated,"" Republican senator Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine, told reporters about the Gaetz selection. ""The president obviously has the right to nominate whomever he wants. But I think this is an example of why it's so important that we have the advice and consent provisions in the Constitution."" Some of Trump's other nominees also lack any meaningful qualifications. Hegseth, while a decorated combat veteran, is best known in recent years as a media personality. He will now oversee the better part of 3 million employees and the world's largest fighting force. ""Being secretary of defence is a very serious job, and putting someone as dangerously unqualified as Pete Hegseth into that role is something that should scare all of us,"" said Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic senator from Illinois who sits on the armed services committee. Not only are Trump's national security and foreign policy nominees universally sceptical of helping Ukraine fend off Russia's invasion, some of their statements have been outright hostile toward Kyiv. Gabbard, who will oversee America's sprawling foreign and domestic intelligence apparatus, has portrayed Putin as a defender of his own nation's vital national security interests. Ukraine, she has said, is a corrupt kleptocracy. One potential guardrail that Trump and his nominees still face: the Senate. While Trump's Republicans control the Senate and most Republican lawmakers will support his nominees for top jobs, the slate the president-elect put forward will likely give the party's remaining moderates pause and test just how loyal elected Republicans are to him and his vision. The choice of Rubio as secretary of state could come as a relief to US partners worried that the Trump administration could pull back from its global network of alliances, including NATO, given Trump's ""America First"" emphasis during his campaign to return to the White House. ""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,"" Trump said of Rubio in a statement. In additional to being a China hawk, Rubio, 53, is an outspoken critic of Cuba's Communist government and strong backer of Israel. He has in the past advocated for a more assertive US foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, although recently his views have aligned more closely with those of Trump's approach to foreign policy. Some analysts questioned whether Rubio would stand up to Trump, noting the president-elect's inclination to make personal loyalty a central requirement for administration posts. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said it is essential for any president's advisers to stand up to him when necessary, given the wide array of foreign policy challenges Trump will face. ""I'm trying to keep an open mind here,"" Miller said, noting that Rubio, because of his experience in Congress, has a better grasp of foreign policy than any of Trump's other appointees."

According to documented sources, the operation was initiated following India's strategic shift after the 1965 Indo-Pakistan conflict. The Border Security Force (BSF) received direct instructions from then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to provide training and shelter facilities to Mukti Bahini operatives. The implementation phase began in February 1971, marking a significant escalation in regional tensions. The operation represented a coordinated effort that followed India's strategic approach to regional conflicts after its experience in the 1965 war. Historical analysis indicates that the operation formed part of a larger strategic framework that emerged in the aftermath of the 1965 conflict, with systematic implementation beginning in early 1971. Archives show that formal operational activities intensified by mid-August 1971. Documentation from the period indicates that the BSF played a central role in the operation's execution, following specific directives from the highest levels of the Indian government. The operation marked a significant phase in the developing crisis that ultimately led to the events of December 1971."

The lawsuit, led by Malcolm X's daughter, Ilyasah Shabazz, and other family members, claims that these law enforcement agencies were aware of the plot to kill him but failed to take action to prevent it. At a press conference, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing the family, stated, “We believe that they all conspired to assassinate Malcolm X, one of the greatest thought leaders of the 20th century."" The wrongful death lawsuit was revealed at a memorial center in New York City, the site where Malcolm X was killed in 1965. It seeks to uncover the truth behind his assassination and correct the historical record, as well as demand justice for the family's suffering. “As a direct result of the Defendants’ intentional, bad faith, willful, wanton, reckless, unreasonable and/or deliberately indifferent acts and omissions, Malcolm X was deprived of his federal constitutional rights, was robbed of his life and freedom, and sustained severe physical, emotional, and monetary damages, including conscious physical pain and suffering,” the lawsuit states. Crump also highlighted that the lawsuit aims to bring reparations to the family. There was no immediate response from the FBI, CIA, or NYPD on the matter. “This cover-up spanned decades, blocking the Shabazz family’s access to the truth and their right to pursue justice,” Crump said in a statement. “We are making history by standing here to confront those wrongs and seeking accountability in the courts.” Malcolm X gained prominence as the national spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, an African American Muslim group advocating for Black separatism. After parting ways with the Nation in 1964, he moderated some of his earlier views on racial separation, which led to death threats from former members. Talmadge Hayer, a former member of the Nation of Islam, later confessed to being one of the three men who assassinated Malcolm X. However, suspicions that the government may have had knowledge of the plot and allowed it to happen have persisted for years. Ilyasah Shabazz, who was only two years old when her father was murdered on February 21, 1965, was present with her mother and siblings when the shooting occurred at New York’s Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights."

Muslim support for Trump helped him win Michigan and may have factored into other swing state wins, strategists believe. Trump picked Republican senator, Marco Rubio, a staunch supporter of Israel for Secretary of State. Rubio said earlier this year he would not call for a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he believed Israel should destroy “every element” of Hamas. “These people are vicious animals,” he added. Trump also nominated Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas Governor and staunch pro-Israel conservative who backs Israeli occupation of the West Bank and has called a two-state solution in Palestine “unworkable”, as the next ambassador to Israel. He has picked Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, who called the UN a “cesspool of anti-Semitism” for its condemnation of deaths in Gaza, to serve as US ambassador to the United Nations. Rexhinaldo Nazarko, executive director of the American Muslim Engagement and Empowerment Network (AMEEN), said Muslim voters had hoped Trump would choose Cabinet officials who work toward peace, and there was no sign of that. “We are very disappointed,” he said. “It seems like this administration has been packed entirely with neoconservatives and extremely pro-Israel, pro-war people, which is a failure on the of President Trump, to the pro-peace and anti-war movement.” Nazarko said the community would continue pressing to make its voices heard after rallying votes to help Trump win. “At least we’re on the map.” Hassan Abdel Salam, a former professor at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and co-founder of the “Abandon Harris” campaign, which endorsed Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, said Trump’s staffing plans were not surprising, but had proven even more extreme that he had feared. “It’s like he’s going on Zionist overdrive,” he said. “We were always extremely sceptical […] Obviously we’re still waiting to see where the administration will go, but it does look like our community has been played.” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Several Muslim and Arab supporters of Trump said they hoped Richard Grenell, Trump’s former acting Director of National Intelligence, would play a key role after he led months of outreach to Muslim and Arab American communities, and was even introduced as a potential next Secretary of State at events. Another key Trump ally, Massad Boulos, the Lebanese father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Tiffany, met repeatedly with Arab-American and Muslim leaders. Both promised Arab-American and Muslim voters that Trump was a candidate for peace who would act swiftly to end the wars in the Middle East and beyond. Neither was immediately reachable. Trump made several visits to cities with large Arab-American and Muslim populations, including a stop in Dearborn, a majority Arab city, where he said he loved Muslims, and Pittsburgh, where he called Muslims for Trump “a beautiful movement. They want peace. They want stability.” Rola Makki, the Lebanese-American, Muslim Vice Chair for Outreach of the Michigan Republican Party, shrugged off the criticism. “I don’t think everyone’s going to be happy with every appointment Trump makes, but the outcome is what matters,” she said. “I do know that Trump wants peace, and what people need to realise is that there’s 50,000 dead Palestinians and 3,000 dead Lebanese, and that’s happened during the current administration.”"
"504","International","Palestine's local soda brand sees surge in demand","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324054-palestine-s-local-soda-brand-sees-surge-in-demand","A small but ambitious company in the West Bank is benefiting from a surge in demand for local alternatives to internationally recognised brands. Chat Cola, produced in a factory located in the town of Salfit, has become a symbol of Palestinian self-reliance as many Palestinians turn away from foreign products, particularly those linked to Israel or the United States. The demand for Chat Cola, whose red and white aluminium cans closely resemble Coca-Cola’s, has skyrocketed since the war erupted in October 2023. According to the company’s owner, Fahed Arar, the increase in sales is largely due to the ongoing boycott movement against Israeli and American products. ""The demand for Chat Cola increased since the war began because of the boycott,"" Arar told AFP from his factory in Salfit. Local consumers, like Ramallah restaurateur Julien, have made the switch to Chat Cola, with many now stocking the Palestinian-made soda in place of more famous brands. Supermarket manager Mahmud Sidr also noted a marked rise in the sales of Palestinian products over the past year, particularly those perceived as ""supporting Palestine."" The global boycott of Coca-Cola has been fuelled by its association with the United States, which continues to provide significant military aid to Israel. While Coca-Cola has stated that it does not support any political causes, the perception among many Palestinians is that the brand, along with other American products, indirectly supports Israel. Despite this, the Palestinian Coca-Cola bottling company, the National Beverage Company, has not seen a major drop in the availability of its products in local stores. However, sales to foreign-named chains have plummeted by up to 80%, according to an anonymous source within the company. The rise in Coca-Cola's popularity highlights a growing desire among Palestinians to support local businesses and reduce reliance on Israeli goods, though challenges remain. Palestinian economist Raja Khalidi pointed out that while there is a clear desire for Palestinian-made alternatives, the lack of production capacity has hindered the full potential of the boycott. ""There's a willingness to boycott if Palestinian producers can match the quality and price of international brands,"" Khalidi said. Chat Cola is one of the few Palestinian companies that has successfully met this demand. Arar is proud of his product, which he describes as having ""Palestinian taste."" However, challenges remain for the company. Israeli authorities have reportedly blocked shipments of raw materials, significantly hampering production. As a result, the factory is only able to meet 10 to 15 percent of the demand for Chat Cola. Despite the obstacles, Arar remains optimistic, citing the political and consumer shift in favour of local products as a significant opportunity. He plans to expand his business beyond the West Bank, with a new factory slated to open in Jordan to meet growing demand in the Arab world. The broader boycott movement, particularly in neighbouring Arab states, has also had notable successes. In Jordan, calls for a boycott led to the closure of Carrefour stores operated by the Majid Al Futtaim Group, further signalling the growing regional solidarity with Palestinian efforts. For now, Chat Cola stands as a testament to the resilience of Palestinian entrepreneurship in the face of ongoing conflict, reflecting a larger desire for independence and self-sufficiency in the region. As the war in Gaza continues, the demand for products like Chat Cola, which embody Palestinian pride and defiance, is expected to keep rising."
"505","International","Sri Lankan president's coalition wins majority in snap election","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324030-sri-lankan-president-s-coalition-wins-majority-in-snap-election","Sri Lankans handed Anura Kumara Dissanayake a thumping win in a snap general election, giving its new leftist president greater legislative power to pursue policies to alleviate poverty and fight graft as the country recovers from a financial meltdown. Dissanayake, a political outsider in a country dominated by family parties for decades, comfortably won the island’s presidential election in September. But his Marxist-leaning coalition, the National People’s Power (NPP), had just three of parliament’s 225 seats before Thursday’s election, prompting him to dissolve it and seek a fresh mandate. The NPP won 107 seats, receiving almost 62% or 6.8 million votes in Thursday’s election, putting them past the majority mark in the parliament, latest results on the Election Commission of Sri Lanka’s website showed. A two-third majority appeared within reach of the coalition. Voters directly elect 196 members to parliament from 22 constituencies under a proportional representation system. The remaining 29 seats will be allocated according to the island-wide proportional vote obtained by each party. “We see this as a critical turning point for Sri Lanka. We expect a mandate to form a strong parliament, and we are confident the people will give us this mandate,” Dissanayake said after casting his vote on Thursday. “There is a change in Sri Lanka’s political culture that started in September, which must continue.” Celebrations were largely muted, with the exception of a few NPP loyalists who lit fireworks in the outskirts of the capital, Colombo. Just over 17 million Sri Lankans were eligible to elect lawmakers for a five-year term. A record 690 political parties and independent groups were contesting across 22 electoral districts. Samagi Jana Balawegaya party of opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, the main challenger to Dissanayake’s coalition, won 28 seats and about 18% of the votes polled. The New Democratic Front, backed by previous President Ranil Wickremesinghe, won just three seats. Sri Lanka typically backs the president’s party in general elections, especially if voting is held soon after a presidential vote. The president wields executive power but Dissanayake still requires a parliamentary majority to appoint a fully-fledged cabinet and deliver on key promises to cut taxes, support local businesses, and fight poverty. He also has plans to abolish Sri Lanka’s contentious executive presidency but requires a two-third majority in parliament to implement it. A nation of 22 million, Sri Lanka was crushed by a 2022 economic crisis triggered by a severe shortage of foreign currency that pushed it into a sovereign default and caused its economy to shrink by 7.3% in 2022 and 2.3% last year. Boosted by a $2.9 billion bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the economy has begun a tentative recovery, but the high cost of living is still a critical issue for many, especially the poor. Dissanayake also aims to tweak targets set by the IMF to rein in income tax and free up funds to invest in welfare for the millions hit hardest by the crisis. But investors worry his desire to revisit the terms of the IMF bailout could delay future disbursements, making it harder for Sri Lanka to hit a key primary surplus target of 2.3% of GDP in 2025 set by the IMF."

""It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,"" said Biden, who is under election-year pressure to stop the Gaza conflict, now in its eighth month. Talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and others to arrange a ceasefire between Israel and the militant Hamas movement in the Gaza war have repeatedly stalled, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress. This proposal comes after weeks of Israeli incursions into Rafah, and new pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government at home and abroad over the deaths in Gaza and the continued captivity of the hostages. Netanyahu's office said on Friday that Israel had authorized negotiators to present a Gaza truce deal after Biden revealed the ceasefire plan. It also comes a day after the Democratic president's Republican rival for president, Donald Trump, was convicted of 34 felony charges, highlighting the sharp contrast between the two candidates. The new proposal Biden laid out is made up of three phases, and breaks from previous proposals because a ceasefire would continue as the parties move through all three. During the first phase, a ceasefire lasting for six weeks, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza population centers, and hostages, including the elderly and women, would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Palestinian civilians would return to Gaza, including northern Gaza, and 600 trucks would bring humanitarian aid into Gaza each day, Biden said. In the second phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate terms of a permanent end to hostilities. ""The ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue,"" the president said, a new development. The third phase would include a major reconstruction plan for Gaza. The proposal has been relayed to Hamas by Qatar, Biden said. The president called on those in Israel who were pushing for ""indefinite"" war to change their minds. ""I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan. And will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition. They've made it clear. They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes,"" Biden said. ""As someone who's had a lifelong commitment to Israel, as the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost,"" he said. ""We can't lose this moment.""

REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters that Israel was able to make the new offer because of recent battleground gains. ""There is now really a road map to the end of the crisis. It is a detailed four-and-half-page agreement,"" the official said. ""It has been negotiated, again, in painstaking detail. And what's on the table now is really kind of an endgame to the process."" Under the plan, each phase would last 42 days, the official added. Several Israeli media outlets described Biden's speech on Friday as dramatic, and interpreted it as an attempt to appeal directly to the Israeli public. Leading Channel 12 interrupted its evening news show to carry Biden's speech live. Israel's censor had previously banned publication of the offer's details, anchor Danny Kushmaro said. This proposal has a higher likelihood of success than previous ones, said Jeremi Suri, a history and public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""Israel has done significant damage to Hamas, and the likelihood of Hamas being able to launch any serious strike or attack or terrorist incident on Israel is not insignificant but it's a lot lower than it was before,"" Suri said. Further, global public perception is ""turning against"" Israel, Suri said, which could encourage Israelis to want a stop to the conflict, along with Biden's influence. ""When the president of United States really gets fully behind something, he can create a lot of incentives,"" Suri said. An earlier hostage proposal put forward this year called for the release of sick, elderly and wounded hostages in Gaza in exchange for a six-week ceasefire that could be extended to allow for more aid to be delivered into the enclave. That proposed deal fell apart earlier this month after Israel refused to agree to Hamas' demand for a permanent end to the war as part of the negotiations and ramped up an assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza. Hamas said on Thursday it had told mediators it would not take part in more negotiations during ongoing aggression but was ready for a ""complete agreement,"" including an exchange of hostages and prisoners, if Israel stopped the war. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan would meet on Friday with diplomats from 17 countries who have citizens held hostage in Gaza by Hamas. An Israeli airstrike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians sparked international outrage, but didn't cross U.S. red lines to cut off military aid to Israel. ""The Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war,"" Biden said on Friday. ""We all saw the terrible images from the deadly fire in Rafah earlier this week, following an Israeli strike ... targeting Hamas."" Palestinian health authorities estimate more than 36,280 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel attacked the enclave in response to an Oct. 7 Hamas assault in southern Israel. The Hamas attack killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies."

During his weekly press briefing on Thursday, when asked about India's alleged decision not to visit Pakistan for next year's ICC Champions Trophy, Patel stressed that India and Pakistan could themselves talk about their bilateral relationship. Speaking on US support for sports diplomacy, Patel said, ""Sports is certainly a potent and connecting force ...this department really [prioritises] the role that sports diplomacy has in connecting people."" He further commented that sports connected many people, and was a great way for ""human-to-human and people-to-people ties that this administration has really prioritised"". Patel also addressed the Nov 9 terrorist attack in Balochistan. He condemned the ""BLA Majeed Brigade’s November 9th bombing at a railway station"" and extended condolences to the victims' families, reaffirming Pakistan and United States’ shared interest in combating such threats. “We have a shared commitment to regional security... we’re going to continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism and violent extremism,” Patel remarked.

The stance contradicts the International Cricket Council's (ICC) policy of separating sports from politics, while potentially influencing Pakistan's established right to host international events despite demonstrated improvements in security infrastructure and successful hosting of recent tournaments. Economic implications of such decisions extend beyond the playing field, affecting sponsorship revenues, broadcasting rights, and tourism income associated with major tournaments. The Pakistan Super League and World Cup qualifiers hosted by Pakistan have shown the country's capability to organize international cricket events successfully. The boycott's impact reaches beyond immediate sporting concerns, affecting player development opportunities and fan engagement. Cricket enthusiasts from both nations traditionally anticipate these high-stakes matches, which have historically served as a bridge for cultural exchange. Regional cricket development faces challenges as such decisions potentially set precedents for other nations. Pakistan has maintained its commitment to participating in tournaments hosted in India, despite bilateral tensions, demonstrating a contrasting approach to sports diplomacy. The Asian Cricket Council faces the challenge of maintaining regional cricket harmony while addressing these complex diplomatic situations. The decision's ripple effects influence various stakeholders, from players to broadcasting networks across the Asian cricket community. International cricket authorities continue to monitor the situation as it affects future tournament planning and the broader objective of using cricket as a tool for regional cooperation and understanding."

The Anti-Narcotics Task Force revealed that the arrested police officer was part of a larger network targeting young individuals, resulting in an increase in substance abuse cases in the region. SP City North Brijesh Sharma is currently heading the investigation. In a related development on November 7, 2024, authorities arrested Constable Parvez Khan along with his two wives, seizing heroin and cash exceeding Rs 250,000 from their residence. The investigation has expanded to identify and seize assets acquired through drug trafficking proceeds. Officials indicate that the operation has domestic roots, with evidence suggesting connections to broader trafficking networks. Between 2017 and 2021, multiple cases emerged involving security personnel in drug trafficking activities. Significant drug seizures at Gujarat's Mundra Port in 2021-22 highlighted the scale of operations, with authorities recovering narcotics worth millions of dollars. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) made a breakthrough in 2021 when they arrested a BSF officer stationed in Handwara district of Kupwara, exposing cross-border connections to the trafficking network. Law enforcement agencies are continuing their investigation, focusing on dismantling the network's financial infrastructure and identifying additional suspects within security institutions."

Speaking on a podcast released this week, Khan, a son of Pakistani immigrants and the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital, said Trump's attacks on him were ""incredibly personal."" ""If I wasn't this skin colour, if I wasn't a practising Muslim, he wouldn't have come for me,"" Khan stated, referring to the US president-elect's criticism of him during both his presidential terms. The feud began in 2017, when Khan spoke out against Trump's controversial travel ban, which targeted several Muslim-majority countries. Trump retaliated by accusing Khan of mishandling terrorism and calling him names such as ""stone cold loser"" and ""very dumb."" Khan, who has long been a vocal critic of Trump's policies, including his stance on sexism, homophobia, and Islamophobia, emphasised his responsibility to speak out against what he described as ""sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, and racist"" policies. The latest remarks come as the UK prepares to navigate its relationship with Trump in his second term. While Khan remains critical, other prominent figures in the Labour Party, such as Foreign Secretary David Lammy, have distanced themselves from past remarks made during Trump's first term.

"512","International","Iran ready to negotiate over nuclear programme but only on own terms","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323990-iran-ready-to-negotiate-over-nuclear-programme-but-only-on-own-terms","Iran has expressed its willingness to resolve the ongoing issues with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding its nuclear programme but has made it clear that it will not be coerced into negotiations under pressure. Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi emphasized this point after meeting with IAEA chief Rafael Grossi in Tehran on Thursday. Despite continued concerns from European powers (E3) over Iran’s nuclear activities and its lack of cooperation with the IAEA, Araqchi stated that Iran is ready to engage in talks based on its national interests and inalienable rights. However, he asserted that negotiations would not be conducted under ""pressure and intimidation."" “The ball is in the EU/E3 court. Willing to negotiate based on our national interest and inalienable rights, but not ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation,” Araqchi wrote on X (formerly Twitter) following his discussions with Grossi. He further added that he hoped the European side would adopt a “rational policy.” The IAEA has faced mounting pressure, particularly from the European powers, to take a firmer stance against Tehran’s nuclear advancements. Sources have indicated that the E3 plans to push for a new resolution against Iran at the upcoming IAEA board meeting next week, citing concerns over Iran's insufficient cooperation in resolving key issues related to its nuclear programme. Tensions between Iran and the IAEA have been escalating in recent months, with key points of contention including Tehran’s refusal to grant the agency’s uranium-enrichment experts access to the country and its failure to provide an adequate explanation for traces of uranium found at undeclared sites. Additionally, Iran’s continued production of highly enriched uranium has raised alarm in the West, with some fearing that Tehran is edging closer to developing a nuclear weapons capability, although Iran insists its nuclear work is for peaceful purposes. Grossi, who has sought to advance diplomatic solutions with Tehran, underscored the importance of continued cooperation with the IAEA, stressing that inspections are just one aspect of the broader relationship. ""Inspections are just one chapter of our cooperation and cannot be discussed,” Grossi said during a press conference alongside Iranian nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami. Relations between Iran and the IAEA soured after the United States withdrew from the 2015 nuclear accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018, and reimposed stringent sanctions on Tehran. In response, Iran began violating key provisions of the agreement, including enriching uranium beyond the agreed-upon limits. Currently, Iran is enriching uranium to levels as high as 60% fissile purity, just shy of the 90% purity needed for weapons-grade material. Tehran maintains that its nuclear programme is strictly for civilian purposes, such as power generation and medical research. Eslami described his meeting with Grossi as ""constructive,"" but warned of a firm response should the IAEA push forward with a resolution against Iran next week. It is believed that Iran may limit its diplomatic and technical cooperation with the agency in retaliation. Grossi, who arrived in Tehran earlier this week, has urged Iran to take concrete steps toward resolving outstanding issues. ""It is in our power here to take concrete steps that will indicate clearly, to the U.S. and the international community, that we can clarify things and move forward with concrete solutions,” Grossi stated. The ongoing diplomatic tensions come as Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, raising questions about the future of U.S. policy toward Iran. During his previous term, Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign led to the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal, further straining relations with Tehran. "
"513","International","Trump taps loyalists with few qualifications for top jobs","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323964-trump-taps-loyalists-with-few-qualifications-for-top-jobs","US President-elect Donald Trump chose loyalists with little experience for several key cabinet positions on Wednesday, stunning some allies and making clear that he is serious about reshaping - and in some cases testing - America's institutions. Trump's choice of congressman Matt Gaetz, 42, for US attorney general, America's top law enforcement officer, was a surprising pick. The former attorney has never worked in the Justice Department, or as a prosecutor, and was investigated by the Justice Department over sex trafficking allegations. His office said in 2023 that he had been told by prosecutors he would not face criminal charges. Trump tapped Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. The former Democratic congresswoman-turned-Trump-ally has in the past spoken out against military intervention in the civil war in Syria under former President Barack Obama and implied that Russian President Vladimir Putin had valid grounds for invading Ukraine, America's ally. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength,"" Trump said in a statement. Gabbard has little direct experience with intelligence work and had not been widely expected to be tapped for the post, which oversees 18 spy agencies. She was deployed in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 as a major in the Hawaii National Guard and is now a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Reserves. On Tuesday, Trump chose Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and veteran, to be his secretary of defence. Hegseth has opposed women in combat roles and questioned whether the top American general was promoted to his position because of his skin colour. He also lobbied Trump during his 2017-2021 term to pardon service members who allegedly committed war crimes. Sprinkled in with those personnel choices were more conventional selections. Trump said on Wednesday he would nominate Senator Marco Rubio, who is a hardliner on China, as his new secretary of state. Also Read: Trump's team drawing up list of Pentagon officers to fire But on the whole, his selections signal a radical shift in the way the US government conducts its business and in the role America will play in the world over the next four years. Trump has said he wants to end the “weaponization” of the Justice Department, which he said brought politically motivated criminal cases against him to hurt his presidential candidacy. The department says it acts without political bias. One common thread for Trump's picks: He chose unfailingly loyal people who are unlikely to push back against his most controversial orders, analysts said. Trump pledged on the campaign trail to go after his political enemies, including Democratic President Joe Biden, a pledge that Gaetz, his attorney general-designate, is unlikely to stand in the way of. ""Gaetz will do exactly as Trump says, which is why he was picked I guess,"" said a source close to Trump, after Gaetz's selection as was announced. A half dozen sources close to Trump world, including donors, consultants and fundraisers, said privately that they were shocked by the choice of Gaetz because of his limited qualifications and past DOJ investigation into him. ""I was shocked that he has been nominated,"" Republican senator Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine, told reporters about the Gaetz selection. ""The president obviously has the right to nominate whomever he wants. But I think this is an example of why it's so important that we have the advice and consent provisions in the Constitution."" Some of Trump's other nominees also lack any meaningful qualifications. Hegseth, while a decorated combat veteran, is best known in recent years as a media personality. He will now oversee the better part of 3 million employees and the world's largest fighting force. ""Being secretary of defence is a very serious job, and putting someone as dangerously unqualified as Pete Hegseth into that role is something that should scare all of us,"" said Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic senator from Illinois who sits on the armed services committee. Not only are Trump's national security and foreign policy nominees universally sceptical of helping Ukraine fend off Russia's invasion, some of their statements have been outright hostile toward Kyiv. Gabbard, who will oversee America's sprawling foreign and domestic intelligence apparatus, has portrayed Putin as a defender of his own nation's vital national security interests. Ukraine, she has said, is a corrupt kleptocracy. One potential guardrail that Trump and his nominees still face: the Senate. While Trump's Republicans control the Senate and most Republican lawmakers will support his nominees for top jobs, the slate the president-elect put forward will likely give the party's remaining moderates pause and test just how loyal elected Republicans are to him and his vision. The choice of Rubio as secretary of state could come as a relief to US partners worried that the Trump administration could pull back from its global network of alliances, including NATO, given Trump's ""America First"" emphasis during his campaign to return to the White House. ""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,"" Trump said of Rubio in a statement. In additional to being a China hawk, Rubio, 53, is an outspoken critic of Cuba's Communist government and strong backer of Israel. He has in the past advocated for a more assertive US foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, although recently his views have aligned more closely with those of Trump's approach to foreign policy. Some analysts questioned whether Rubio would stand up to Trump, noting the president-elect's inclination to make personal loyalty a central requirement for administration posts. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said it is essential for any president's advisers to stand up to him when necessary, given the wide array of foreign policy challenges Trump will face. ""I'm trying to keep an open mind here,"" Miller said, noting that Rubio, because of his experience in Congress, has a better grasp of foreign policy than any of Trump's other appointees."

He noted that Israel has taken action on 12 of the 15 steps outlined in a letter from Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J Austin a month ago, which called for measures to address the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “The effect has been that of the 15 steps that we urged action on, Israel has taken action either in implementing or being in the process of implementing 12 of the 15 steps."" Blinken specified three key actions that Israel still needs to fully address: allowing displaced civilians to return to their homes, restoring commercial trucking, and extending humanitarian pauses in Gaza to allow aid to reach those in need. “And again, they have to be fully implemented, and they have to be sustained,” he added,” he added. “Even with all of these steps, the situation is so difficult and so dramatic that to fully redress it, to fully answer the needs of people, the best way to do that is to end the war,” Blinken said. He suggested that Israel “by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the goals that it set for itself, (and) the strategic goals it set for itself,” adding: “So this should be a time to end the war.” Blinken said that Israeli hostages should be safely returned home and a clear plan should be devised for Israel to withdraw from Gaza without allowing Hamas to return to administer in the enclave. “But short of ending the war, which we believe now is the time to move to that, we have to see these humanitarian steps fully implemented, sustained, and as I said, particularly with regard to pauses having more extensive pauses,” he said. Since the beginning of Israel’s offensive on Gaza on October 7, 2023, the violence has led to more than 43,700 casualties, with widespread destruction making much of the region unlivable. Israel currently faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its actions in Gaza."
"515","International","Trump's team drawing up list of Pentagon officers to fire","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323962-trump-s-team-drawing-up-list-of-pentagon-officers-to-fire","Members of US President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team are drawing up a list of military officers to be fired, potentially to include the Joint Chiefs of Staff, two sources said, in what would be an unprecedented shake-up at the Pentagon. The planning for the firings is at an early stage after Trump’s Nov 5 election victory and could change as Trump’s administration takes shape, said the sources, who are familiar with the Trump transition and requested anonymity to speak candidly about the plans. One of the sources questioned the feasibility of a mass firing at the Pentagon. It was also unclear if Trump himself would endorse the plan, although in the past he has railed extensively against defence leaders who have criticized him. Trump has also spoken during the campaign of firing “woke” generals and those responsible for the troubled 2021 pull-out from Afghanistan. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The second source said the incoming administration would likely focus on US military officers seen as connected to Mark Milley, Trump’s former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milley was quoted in the book War by Bob Woodward, which was published last month, calling Trump “fascist to the core” and Trump’s allies have targeted him for perceived disloyalty to the former president. “Every single person that was elevated and appointed by Milley will be gone,” the second source said. “There’s a very detailed list of everybody that was affiliated with Milley. And they will all be gone.” The Joint Chiefs of Staff include the highest ranking officers in the US military and comprise the heads of the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, National Guard and Space Force. The disclosure of plans to fire senior leaders of the US armed forces comes a day after Trump picked as his defence secretary Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and veteran who has signalled a willingness to clean house at the Pentagon. “The next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. Lots of people need to be fired,” Hegseth said in his 2024 book “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.” It is unclear if Hegseth’s lack of management experience could complicate his Senate confirmation and if a more traditional alternative for the position would carry out such sweeping dismissals. Hegseth has also taken aim at Milley’s successor, Air Force General CQ Brown, asking whether he would have got the job if he were not Black. “Was it because of his skin colour? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt - which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter,” he wrote. The first source familiar with the transition planning said Brown would be among the many officers to leave. “The chiefs of the Joint Chiefs and all the vice chiefs will be fired immediately,” the source said, before noting that this was still only early planning. Some current and former US officials have played down the possibility of such a major shake-up, saying it would be unnecessary and disruptive at a time of global turmoil with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. The first source said that it would be difficult bureaucratically to fire and replace a large swath of senior US military officials, suggesting the planning could be bluster and posturing by Trump allies. But the second source suggested the Trump camp believed the Joint Chiefs of Staff needed to shrink due to perceived bureaucratic over-reach. Such cuts could be endured in an organization the scale of the US military, the source said. “These people are not irreplaceable. They are very replaceable. And then the other thing too is there is no shortage of people that will step up,” the source said. “In World War Two, we were very rapidly appointing people in their 30s or people competent to be generals. And you know what? We won the war.”"

However, Kuki tribal representatives strongly dispute this narrative, asserting that the victims were village volunteers from their community. The situation has further deteriorated with reports of six individuals, including three women and three children, going missing from the Jiribam area. Additionally, authorities discovered the bodies of two elderly individuals amid debris, showing signs of physical trauma. Kuki-majority districts have announced a strike in response to the incident.

His comments come a week after Donald Trump’s election victory, amid mounting uncertainty over the future of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Araghchi noted, ""The communication channels between us and the Americans still exist,"" while acknowledging deep-seated issues between Tehran and Washington.""We have differences with the Americans, which are sometimes very fundamental and central and may not be resolved, but we must manage them to reduce their costs and decrease the tensions,"" he remarked. These statements followed Araghchi’s October 14 comments in Oman, where he emphasized Iran’s unwillingness to engage in indirect nuclear talks with the United States under the current circumstances.""We don’t see any grounds for these talks until we can get past the current crisis,"" Araghchi stated during his visit to the Gulf sultanate, which has historically acted as a mediator between Iran and the United States, whose diplomatic relations were severed after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also echoed Araghchi's sentiments on Tuesday, noting that, regardless of Tehran’s position, it is inevitable that Iran will encounter the United States in regional and global arenas. ""Whether we like it or not, we will eventually face this country...it is better to manage this issue ourselves,"" Pezeshkian said. Iran, which has been under extensive international sanctions, secured a nuclear deal with major powers in 2015, aimed at limiting its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. However, the deal unraveled after Trump’s administration withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reinstated stringent sanctions. Ahead of Grossi’s visit, Araghchi acknowledged persistent issues between Tehran and the IAEA.

The Oval Office meeting, held just a week after Trump’s victory in the November 5 election, was seen as a significant moment.“We’ll ensure the transition is smooth and everything is ready for you,” Biden, 81, assured Trump, who responded, “It’ll be as smooth as it can get.” The meeting was a stark contrast to the years of criticism the two leaders had exchanged. During their campaigns, Biden had frequently portrayed Trump as a threat to democracy, while Trump called Biden unfit for office. The two sat beside a roaring fireplace, an unusual scene considering the previous heated exchanges and political animosity between them. The visit comes as a symbolic end to Biden’s term after Democratic concerns around his age and mental fitness to serve a second term emerged during a debate with Trump earlier this year. Under mounting pressure, Biden had stepped aside in July, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.However, Harris was unable to overcome Trump’s broad support, leading to his victory with 312 electoral votes to her 226. Trump swept all seven critical swing states, including Pennsylvania and Arizona, regaining the presidency in a historic non-consecutive second term. First Lady Jill Biden was also present to congratulate Trump, handing him a personal note addressed to former First Lady Melania Trump. In a gesture that underscored Biden’s commitment to the presidential traditions, he extended this invitation to Trump despite Trump’s refusal to offer him the same courtesy in 2020. Earlier, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre highlighted Biden’s determination to uphold democratic norms. “President Biden has always respected the institution of the presidency and believes in the peaceful transfer of power,” she told reporters, a message reinforced by Biden’s gesture to invite his successor to the Oval Office. Outside the White House gates, preparations for Trump’s inauguration were already underway, with construction teams assembling the parade stands. Trump will take the oath on January 20, 2025, formally returning to the office he held from 2016 to 2020."

The powerful eruption, which occurred a day earlier, sent a massive ash cloud 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) into the sky, prompting aviation safety concerns. Carriers such as Jetstar, Qantas, Virgin Australia, Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia, and Singapore’s Scoot have grounded flights due to the volcanic activity. The ash cloud poses a significant risk to aircraft operations, with the potential to damage engines and obscure visibility, airlines warned. Mount Lewotobi, which has been erupting intermittently in recent weeks, has already claimed the lives of nine people, with 31 others injured and over 11,000 people evacuated. The 1,703-meter (5,587-foot) volcano continues to be a threat to both local residents and international travelers. As of Wednesday, Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport was operating normally, with no ash detected in the airspace after tests were conducted. However, the ongoing eruptions continue to affect flight schedules. Virgin Australia has made changes to its schedule, while Jetstar and Qantas both halted flights to Bali until Thursday. Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific and Malaysia’s AirAsia have also suspended flights. In response to the disruptions, airlines are offering passengers affected by cancellations options for refunds, rescheduling, or re-routing. Bali’s airport operator, PT Angkasa Pura, urged passengers to stay informed and follow updates from airlines. The island's tourism-dependent economy faces significant challenges from the ongoing eruptions, which have intensified concerns over the safety of flights in the region. Indonesia, located along the Pacific Ring of Fire, remains one of the world’s most disaster-prone nations due to its active volcanoes and seismic activity. Authorities are closely monitoring the situation and will provide further updates on volcanic activity and flight disruptions."

Starting his speech, Shehbaz congratulated Azerbaijan’s president for hosting the summit and emphasized the dire consequences faced by Pakistan and several other vulnerable nations due to climate change. ""If timely measures are not taken, there will be more damage in the future,"" he warned. Prime Minister Sharif highlighted Pakistan's ongoing recovery from the devastating 2022 floods due to environmental changes, which caused more than $30 billion in damages, destroyed thousands of acres of crops, left numerous buildings, including schools, in ruins, and displaced thousands of people. He stressed that Pakistan, despite contributing only minimally to global emissions, ranks among the top 10 countries most affected by climate change. ""The world promised to help Pakistan following the damage caused by the environmental disaster,"" he recalled. Shehbaz urged global leaders to honour commitments made during COP28, noting that the pledges of financial assistance for climate-induced damages have not yet been fully implemented. ""If timely measures are not taken, we risk further catastrophic damage. We don't want other countries to face the same situation as Pakistan did,"" he warned. He outlined Pakistan's climate resilience efforts, including the development of a National Carbon Market Framework and an ambitious target to transition 30% of the country’s vehicles to alternative energy by the end of the decade. ""The world must help developing countries like Pakistan,"" the PM declared. Additionally, Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to investing in alternative energy sources, underlining the need for environmental protection on an emergency basis to ensure a safe future. PM Sharif further emphasized that Pakistan will transfer 30% of vehicles to alternative energy by the end of the decade, adding that developing countries required $6.8 trillion to implement Vision 2030. He also stressed the importance of grants rather than loans in climate finance for developing nations, arguing that such countries cannot bear additional debt. Sharif acknowledged the contributions of PPP leader Sherry Rehman in taking strong measures related to climate change. He warned that heavy losses may have to be borne if no measures are taken for the future, recalling that he had said two years ago that the future requires comprehensive measures. He concluded with a call for the international community’s support, stating, ""We cannot alone take measures against environmental pollution. The support and help of the international community will be needed."""
"522","International","Trump picks ex-top US spy John Ratcliffe to lead CIA","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323907-trump-picks-ex-top-us-spy-john-ratcliffe-to-lead-cia","US President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had picked John Ratcliffe, a close ally who was director of national intelligence at the end of his first term, to serve as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Ratcliffe served as the nation's top spy from late May 2020 until Trump left office in January 2021. More recently, he was co-chair of the Center for American Security, a think tank advocating Trump positions, and advised the former Republican president on national security policy during his 2024 campaign. ""I look forward to John being the first person ever to serve in both of our Nation’s highest Intelligence positions. He will be a fearless fighter for the Constitutional Rights of all Americans, while ensuring the Highest Levels of National Security, and PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,"" Trump said in a statement announcing the nomination. Ratcliffe, a former member of the House of Representatives, promised at his confirmation hearing to be DNI in May 2020 that he would provide ""objective and timely intelligence"" in the position. He also said he would closely monitor other issues like Iran's military, North Korea's nuclear weapons program and foreign interference in the US election. When Ratcliffe was confirmed as DNI in 2020 by the Republican-majority Senate, all Democratic senators voted against his nomination, citing his lack of experience and partisanship. With Republicans again controlling the chamber next year, and months of experience as DNI, he is expected to be easily approved this time. More recently, Ratcliffe has criticized how Democratic President Joe Biden's administration has approached the conflict in the Middle East. In an article published in June, he argued that Biden's threat to withhold weapons shipments to Israel over its military actions in Gaza had put a key ally at risk. He also argued that the administration had not been tough enough on Iran. Ratcliffe also positioned himself as a China hawk during his tenure as DNI. ""The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the US and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,"" Ratcliffe wrote in a December 2020 article in the Wall Street Journal. As DNI, Democrats and former intelligence officials accused him of declassifying intelligence to benefit Trump and his Republican allies. They claimed he used this information to attack political opponents, including Biden, then Trump's rival for the presidency. Ratcliffe's office denied this charge. It was the second time Trump nominated Ratcliffe for the post. He was the most junior member of the House Intelligence Committee, with just six months on the panel, when Trump first said he wanted to appoint him in July 2019. Trump quickly abandoned Ratcliffe's first nomination when members of Congress worried he was too inexperienced and too partisan. But Republicans supported Ratcliffe when Trump picked him again, saying the office of DNI was too important to be filled with only acting officials. Ratcliffe had represented a Texas congressional district since 2015 and served on the House intelligence and judiciary committees. He became known as an outspoken defender of Trump during the Democratic-led proceedings that resulted in Trump's 2019 impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Republican-led Senate later acquitted Trump, the only US president to be impeached twice. Trump has had a rocky relationship with intelligence agencies, including the CIA, accusing their employees of being part of the ""deep state,"" his term for career federal employees he accuses of pursuing their own agendas."
"523","International","Trump names anti-'woke' Fox News host Hegseth as defence secy","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323905-trump-names-anti-woke-fox-news-host-hegseth-as-defence-secy","US President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday he has picked as his secretary of defence Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and veteran who has expressed disdain for the so-called “woke” policies of Pentagon leaders including its top military officer. Hegseth, if confirmed by the US Senate, could make good on Trump's campaign promises to rid the US military of generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies on diversity in the ranks that conservatives have rallied against. It could also set up a collision course between Hegseth and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General CQ Brown, a former fighter pilot with command experience in the Pacific and the Middle East, who Hegseth accused of “pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians.” The 44-year-old NATO sceptic is perhaps Trump's most surprising pick as he fills out his cabinet ahead of the Jan 20 inauguration, and the decision drew swift condemnation from some of Trump's opponents. “The job of Secretary of Defence should not be an entry-level position,” Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said on X. Trump, announcing his decision, praised Hegseth, who is an Army National Guard veteran and according to his website served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. “Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,” Trump said in a statement. “With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down.” While Hegseth has articulated only limited policy positions in the past, he has railed against NATO allies for being weak and said that China is on the verge of dominating its neighbours. Hegseth has said he left the military in 2021 after being sidelined for his political and religious views by an Army that didn't want him any more. “The feeling was mutual - I didn't want this Army any more either,” Hegseth said in his book “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.” There is already anxiety in the Pentagon that Trump aims to root out military officers and career civil servants he perceives to be disloyal. Culture war issues could be a trigger for firings. Trump told Fox News in June he would fire generals he described as “woke,” a term for those focused on racial and social justice but which is used by conservatives to disparage progressive policies. Hegseth could be an advocate for such firings. “The next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. Lots of people need to be fired,” he wrote in his book. Hegseth also took aim at Brown in particular, asking whether he would have gotten the job if he were not Black. “Was it because of his skin colour? Or his skill? We'll never know, but always doubt - which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn't really much matter,” he wrote. Trump's former US generals and defence secretaries are among his fiercest critics, with some declaring him unfit for office. Trump has suggested that his former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, could be executed for treason. Hegseth has also slammed Milley for failing to execute Trump's policies dutifully when in office and accusing him of being “a partisan to the end” to aid Democrats. Hegseth has been sharply critical of America's European allies and his selection could fuel even greater anxiety in NATO about what a Trump administration will mean for the alliance. “Outdated, outgunned, invaded, and impotent. Why should America, the European 'emergency contact number' for the past century, listen to self-righteous and impotent nations asking us to honour outdated and one-sided defence arrangements they no longer live up to?” Hegseth wrote in his book. “Maybe if NATO countries actually ponied up for their own defence — but they don't. They just yell about the rules while gutting their militaries and yelling at America for help.” In appearances on podcasts and television he has said China is building a military “specifically dedicated to defeating the United States of America.” “They have a full spectrum long-term view of not just regional but global domination, and we are we have our heads up our asses,” Hegseth said on a podcast last week. During the same appearance, Hegseth said Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine appeared to be “Putin's give-me-my-shit-back war.” Trump has been critical of President Joe Biden's assistance for Ukraine, fuelling concern about the future of support for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government under a Republican-controlled White House, Senate and possibly House of Representatives. “If Ukraine can defend themselves... great, but I don't want American intervention driving deep into Europe and making (Putin) feel like he's so much on his heels,” Hegseth said."

The development marks another chapter in the ongoing ethnic tensions plaguing the northeastern state. The Kuki Zo Council has alleged that Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel conducted fake encounters, resulting in the deaths of their community members. In response to these fatalities, tribal groups announced a shutdown across Manipur from 5 AM to 6 PM. According to tribal representatives, the deceased individuals were unarmed, contradicting official claims about their involvement in aggressive actions. The situation has further deteriorated with reports of five individuals going missing from a Kuki relief camp located within a police station compound, with family members claiming they were killed in custody. Local officials have acknowledged the disappearances from the relief camp and initiated an investigation into the matter. These incidents have intensified the existing ethnic conflicts in Manipur, with tribal leaders now advocating for a separate state.

According to documented sources, the operation was initiated following India's strategic shift after the 1965 Indo-Pakistan conflict. The Border Security Force (BSF) received direct instructions from then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to provide training and shelter facilities to Mukti Bahini operatives. The implementation phase began in February 1971, marking a significant escalation in regional tensions. The operation represented a coordinated effort that followed India's strategic approach to regional conflicts after its experience in the 1965 war. Historical analysis indicates that the operation formed part of a larger strategic framework that emerged in the aftermath of the 1965 conflict, with systematic implementation beginning in early 1971. Archives show that formal operational activities intensified by mid-August 1971. Documentation from the period indicates that the BSF played a central role in the operation's execution, following specific directives from the highest levels of the Indian government. The operation marked a significant phase in the developing crisis that ultimately led to the events of December 1971."

The stance contradicts the International Cricket Council's (ICC) policy of separating sports from politics, while potentially influencing Pakistan's established right to host international events despite demonstrated improvements in security infrastructure and successful hosting of recent tournaments. Economic implications of such decisions extend beyond the playing field, affecting sponsorship revenues, broadcasting rights, and tourism income associated with major tournaments. The Pakistan Super League and World Cup qualifiers hosted by Pakistan have shown the country's capability to organize international cricket events successfully. The boycott's impact reaches beyond immediate sporting concerns, affecting player development opportunities and fan engagement. Cricket enthusiasts from both nations traditionally anticipate these high-stakes matches, which have historically served as a bridge for cultural exchange. Regional cricket development faces challenges as such decisions potentially set precedents for other nations. Pakistan has maintained its commitment to participating in tournaments hosted in India, despite bilateral tensions, demonstrating a contrasting approach to sports diplomacy. The Asian Cricket Council faces the challenge of maintaining regional cricket harmony while addressing these complex diplomatic situations. The decision's ripple effects influence various stakeholders, from players to broadcasting networks across the Asian cricket community.

The report estimates that between 6,000 to 6,500 TTP fighters are currently present in Afghanistan. The Pentagon has expressed worry about the growing terrorist threats in Afghanistan. Major General Pat Ryder, Pentagon Press Secretary, emphasized the need for continued focus on counter-terrorism efforts. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also voiced concerns in May about the presence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan, mentioning ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and their affiliates as active entities in the country. The Afghan Taliban government, however, denies these claims. The Taliban's Army Chief stated that Pakistan has not provided evidence of TTP's presence in Afghanistan or its cross-border activities against Pakistan. UN member states have noted that NATO weapons left behind after the Taliban takeover have reportedly been supplied to groups like the TTP, potentially contributing to increased attacks on Pakistani border posts. The situation has led to tensions between Afghanistan and neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan, which has repeatedly expressed its concerns about cross-border terrorist activities.

This decision, issued by the Taliban's Ministry of Education, further limits educational opportunities for women and girls in the country. Since taking control in August 2021, the Taliban has suspended education for girls above the sixth grade. The recent ban affects secondary and university-level educational programs that were being broadcast on local media, which had gained popularity as an alternative means of education. According to a UNESCO report, over 1.4 million Afghan girls have been denied access to secondary education under Taliban rule. The report also states that there has been a decrease of 1.1 million in primary school enrollment for both boys and girls. Media representatives in Khost province reported that this move not only extinguishes the last hope for girls' education but also eliminates a significant source of income for media outlets. Previously, the Taliban had also prohibited women and girls in Khost province from watching media channels on their phones. The UNESCO report highlights that approximately 2.5 million girls, representing 80% of the female school-age population in Afghanistan, are currently out of school due to Taliban policies.

According to a report by The Guardian, since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, there have been hundreds of cases where women have been brutally murdered. The Center for Information Resilience has documented 332 cases of women being killed by men since the Taliban's takeover, though this number likely represents only a fraction of the actual incidents, as many crimes are concealed to protect the Taliban's image. In addition to these killings, gender-based violence has surged, reflecting the dark reality of life for Afghan women under Taliban rule. An international report highlights that since January 2022, 840 women and girls have been subjected to gender-based violence, with many of them holding the Taliban responsible for their plight. The reported cases include 115 instances of sexual violence, including forced marriage, sexual slavery, assault, and rape. Furthermore, 113 women have been arrested for allegedly violating the Taliban's oppressive policies, according to the same report. David Osborne, the project director, emphasized that speaking out against violence and femicide in Afghanistan has become increasingly difficult due to the Taliban's tight grip on the country. He added that the Taliban's actions have effectively excluded 14 million Afghan women and girls from all aspects of life. The ongoing violence and oppression faced by Afghan women demand urgent global attention, with calls for the Taliban to be held accountable on the international stage."

But he added the group supported the efforts of parliament speaker Nabih Berri - a Hezbollah ally - to secure a ceasefire, for the first time omitting any mention of a Gaza truce deal as a pre-condition for halting the group's fire on Israel. His 30-minute televised address came just days after senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine was thought to have been the target of an Israeli strike and 11 days after the killing of Hezbollah's secretary general Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Safieddine's killing was confirmed by Hezbollah on Oct. 23. Qassem was appointed deputy chief in 1991 by the armed group's then-secretary general Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack the following year. Qassem remained in his role when Nasrallah became leader, and has long been one of Hezbollah's leading spokesmen, conducting interviews with foreign media including as cross-border hostilities with Israel raged over the last year. Qassem's televised address on Oct. 8 was his second since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah intensified in September. He was the first member of Hezbollah's top leadership to make televised remarks after Nasrallah's killing in an Israeli air attack on Beirut's southern suburbs on Sept. 27. Speaking on Sept. 30, Qassem said Hezbollah would choose a successor to its slain secretary general ""at the earliest opportunity"" and would continue to fight Israel in solidarity with Palestinians. ""What we are doing is the bare minimum... We know that the battle may be long,"" he said in a 19-minute speech. Born in 1953 in Beirut to a family from Lebanon's south, Qassem's political activism began with the Lebanese Shi'ite Amal Movement. He left the group in 1979 in the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution, which shaped the political thinking of many young Lebanese Shi'ite activists. Qassem took part in meetings that led to the formation of Hezbollah, established with the backing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. He has been the general coordinator of Hezbollah's parliamentary election campaigns since the group first contested them in 1992. In 2005, he wrote a history of Hezbollah seen as a rare ""insider's look"" into the organisation. Qassem wears a white turban unlike Nasrallah and Safieddine, whose black turbans denoted their status as descendants of the Prophet Muhammad."

The group said in a written statement that its Shura Council had elected Qassem, 71, in accordance with its established mechanism for choosing a secretary general. He was appointed as Hezbollah's deputy chief in 1991 by the armed group's then-secretary general Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack the following year. Qassem remained in his role when Nasrallah became leader, and has long been one of Hezbollah's leading spokesmen, conducting interviews with foreign media, including as cross-border hostilities with Israel raged over the last year. Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27, and senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine - considered the most likely successor - was killed in Israeli strikes a week later. Since Nasrallah's killing, Qassem has given three televised addresses, including one on Oct. 8 in which he said the armed group supported efforts to reach a ceasefire for Lebanon."
"537","International","Israel bans UN agency for Palestinian refugees","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323173-israel-bans-un-agency-for-palestinian-refugees","Israel's parliament passed a law on Monday to ban the UN relief agency UNRWA from operating inside the country, alarming some of Israel's Western allies who fear it will worsen the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Israeli officials cited the involvement of a handful of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees' thousands of staffers in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel and a few staffers' membership in Hamas and other armed groups. ""UNRWA workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said the vote opposes the U.N. charter and violates international law. ""This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to #Palestine Refugees,"" he wrote on social media platform X. The vote came the same day Israeli tanks thrust deeper into northern Gaza, trapping 100,000 civilians, the Palestinian emergency service said, in what Israel's military said were operations to eliminate regrouping Hamas militants. The Israeli military said soldiers captured around 100 suspected militants in a raid on a hospital in the Jabalia camp. Hamas and medics have denied any militant presence at the hospital. The Gaza Strip's health ministry said at least 19 people were killed by Israeli airstrikes and bombardment on Monday. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said around 100,000 people were marooned in Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun without medical or food supplies. Reuters could not verify the number independently. The emergency service said its operations had come to a halt because of the three-week Israeli assault into northern Gaza, where Israel had said it wiped out Hamas combat forces earlier in the year-long war. Talks led by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar to broker a ceasefire resumed on Sunday after multiple abortive attempts. Egypt's president proposed a two-day truce to exchange four Israeli hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners, followed by talks within 10 days on a permanent ceasefire. Netanyahu had said mediators would resume talks in coming days ""in a continued attempt to advance a deal."" Israel has repeatedly said the war will go on until Hamas is eradicated while the Islamist movement has ruled out any end to fighting until Israeli forces leave Gaza. Gaza's war has kindled wider conflict in the Middle East, raising concern about global oil supplies, with Israel bombing Lebanon and sending forces into its south to disable Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Hamas ally. At least 16 people were killed in Israeli strikes on three villages in eastern Lebanon's city of Baalbek, the Lebanese health ministry said on Monday. The conflict also triggered rare direct clashes between regional arch-foes Israel and Iran. Israeli warplanes pounded Iranian missile production sites during the weekend in retaliation for an Oct. 1 Iranian missile volley at Israel. Iran's Foreign Ministry said Tehran would ""use all available tools"" to respond. Israel continued battering Lebanon on Monday, including an early-morning airstrike on a district in the southern port of Tyre that left seven dead, the Lebanese health ministry said. Lebanon's health authority said Israeli attacks in Lebanon have killed at least 2,710 people and injured 12,592 others in the past year. The Israeli military later issued an evacuation order for much of Tyre, including areas that included neighbourhoods near a seaside hotel where journalists are usually based. Footage circulated online of civil defence workers urging people to leave. ""For your safety, because of the warning, evacuate immediately!"" one shouted into a megaphone attached to a car. Israel's expanding evacuation warnings have made ghost towns out of much of southern Lebanon, including Tyre, and the bombing campaign has left many towns in ruins. Hezbollah carried out attacks on Israeli troops within Lebanese territory and on military targets within Israel. North Gaza's three major hospitals, whose officials refused Israel's orders to evacuate, were hardly operating. At least two were damaged and had run out of medical, food and fuel stocks. At least one doctor, a nurse and two child patients had died. North Gaza residents said Israel was besieging shelters housing displaced families, ordering them out before rounding up men and pushing women and children to leave. Only a few families headed toward southern Gaza as the majority preferred to relocate temporarily in Gaza City, fearing they could otherwise never regain access to their homes. Some said they had written their death notices. ""While the world is busy with Lebanon and new nonsense talk about a few days of ceasefire (in Gaza), the Israeli occupation is wiping out north Gaza and displacing its people,"" a resident of Jabalia told Reuters via a chat app. The Israeli military says its forces operate in keeping with international law and accuses militants of hiding fighters and weapons in hospitals and schools, which Hamas denies. The north was the first part of Gaza hammered by Israel's ground offensive after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Intensive bombing largely flattened towns. Nevertheless, Hamas-led militants continue to attack Israeli forces in hit-and-run operations. Hamas' 2023 attack killed 1,200 people and resulted in more than 250 hostages being taken into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. The death toll from Israel's retaliatory air and ground onslaught in Gaza has reached 43,020, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday."

Iran previously played down Israel's air attack on Saturday, saying it caused only limited damage, while U.S. President Joe Biden called for a halt to escalation that has raised fears of an all-out conflagration in the Middle East. Speaking at a weekly televised news conference, Baghaei said: ""(Iran) will use all available tools to deliver a definite and effective response to the Zionist regime (Israel)"". The nature of Iran's response depends on the nature of the Israeli attack, Baghaei added, without elaborating. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Iranian officials should determine how best to demonstrate Iran's power to Israel, adding that the Isreli attack should ""neither be downplayed nor exaggerated"". Scores of Israeli jets completed three waves of strikes before dawn on Saturday against missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran, Israel's military said. The heavily armed arch-enemies have engaged in a cycle of retaliatory moves against each other for months, with Saturday's strike coming after an Iranian missile barrage on Oct. 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defences. Iran backs Hezbollah, which is engaged in heavy fighting with Israeli forces in Lebanon, and also the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is battling Israel in the Gaza Strip."

Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi made the announcement as efforts to defuse the devastating, more than year-long war resumed in Qatar with the directors of the CIA and Israel's Mossad intelligence agency taking part. Speaking alongside Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune during a press conference in Cairo, Sisi also said that talks should resume within 10 days of implementing the temporary ceasefire in efforts to reach a permanent one. There was no immediate comment from Israel or Hamas but a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters: ""I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza."" Israel has said the war cannot end until Hamas has been wiped out as a military force and governing entity in Gaza. The U.S., Qatar and Egypt have been spearheading negotiations to end the war that erupted after Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7 last year, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies. The death toll from Israel's retaliatory air and ground onslaught in Gaza is approaching 43,000, Gaza health officials say, with the densely populated enclave in ruins. An official briefed on the talks told Reuters earlier on Sunday that negotiations in Doha will seek a short-term ceasefire and the release of some hostages being held by Hamas in exchange for Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners. The objective, still elusive after multiple mediation attempts, is to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a halt in fighting for less than a month in the hope this would lead to a more permanent ceasefire. At least 43 of those killed in Gaza on Sunday were in the north of the enclave, where Israeli troops have returned to root out Hamas fighters who it says have regrouped there. The United Nations said the plight of Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza was ""unbearable"" and the conflict was being ""waged with little regard for the requirements of international humanitarian law"". ""The Secretary-General (Antonio Guterres) is shocked by the harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction in the north, with civilians trapped under rubble, the sick and wounded going without life-saving health care, and families lacking food and shelter, amid reports of families being separated and many people detained,"" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. Israeli authorities were hampering efforts to deliver food, medicine and other essential humanitarian supplies, putting lives at risk, he said. The devastation and deprivation resulting from Israeli military operations in the north were making life there untenable. Israel says its forces operate in accordance with international law. It says it targets Hamas operatives who conceal themselves among the civilian population which they use as human shields, a charge Hamas denies. It denies blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza, blaming international organisations for problems distributing it and accusing Hamas of stealing from aid convoys. Earlier on Sunday, 20 people were killed following an airstrike on houses in Jabalia, the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, which has been the focus of an Israeli military offensive for more than three weeks, medics and the Palestinian official news agency WAFA said. Another Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinian families in Shati camp in Gaza City, killed nine people and wounded 20 others, with many in critical condition, medics said. Footage circulated on Palestinian media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed people rushing to the bomb site to help evacuate the casualties. Bodies were scattered on the ground, while some carried wounded children in their arms before loading them in a vehicle. The Israeli military said it was looking into the report on the strike on the school. Three local journalists were among those killed at the school in Shati - Saed Radwan, head of digital media at Hamas Al-Aqsa television, Hanin Baroud, and Hamza Abu Selmeya, according to Hamas media. On Sunday, Israel's military said it had killed more than 40 militants in the Jabalia area in the past 24 hours, as well as dismantling infrastructure and locating large quantities of military equipment. Israeli military strikes on the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza have so far killed around 800 people during a three-week offensive, the Gaza health ministry said."

In a televised statement, Sanchez said the government was sending 5,000 more army troops to help with the searches and clean-up in addition to 2,500 soldiers already deployed. ""It is the biggest operation by the Armed Forces in Spain in peacetime,"" Sanchez said. ""The government is going to mobilize all the resources necessary as long as they are needed."" Valencian regional authorities said on Saturday night the total number of fatalities in the region was 211, plus two from Castilla La Mancha and one in Andalusia. The tragedy is already Europe's worst flood-related disaster since 1967 when at least 500 people died in Portugal. Hopes of finding survivors were raised when rescuers found a woman alive after three days trapped in a car park in Montcada, Valencia. Residents burst into applause when civil protection chief Martin Perez announced the news. Volunteers flocked to Valencia's City of Arts and Sciences centre on Saturday for the first coordinated clean-up organised by regional authorities. The venue has been turned into the nerve centre for the operation. In Valencia's Picanya suburb, shop-owner Emilia, 74, told Reuters on Saturday: ""We feel abandoned, there are many people who need help. It is not only my house, it's all the houses and we are throwing away furniture, we are throwing away everything. ""When is the help going to come to have fridges and washing machines? Because we can't even wash our clothes and we can't even have a shower."" Nurse Maria Jose Gilabert, 52, who also lives in Picanya, said: ""We are devastated because there is not much light to be seen here at the moment, not because they are not coming to help, they are coming from all over Spain, but because it will be a long time before this becomes a habitable area again."" The storm triggered a new weather alert in the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and Valencia, where rains are expected to continue during the weekend. Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Europe, and elsewhere, due to climate change. Meteorologists think the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe."

Serbia’s Interior Minister, Ivica Dačić, reported the updated death toll, adding that rescue operations are ongoing in Novi Sad, a city located about 70 kilometres (43 miles) northwest of the capital, Belgrade. Local media reported over 30 injuries, with two survivors currently hospitalized, according to a statement from the Interior Ministry. Rescuers are also in contact with two other individuals still trapped under the rubble, Dačić confirmed, noting, “We are working on getting them out."" Nearly 80 rescue personnel were dispatched to the site shortly after the emergency call was received. The operation is expected to continue for several more hours. Local residents have lit candles outside the station in remembrance, while the government declared a day of mourning on Saturday. Prime Minister Miloš Vučević expressed condolences to the victims’ families and thanked first responders for their swift action. Vučević also pledged accountability for the disaster, saying on Serbian state TV Radio Television of Serbia (RTS), “I assure you that the responsible will be punished."" According to N1, the station’s roof had been renovated in 2021, with additional work completed months later. The building officially reopened on July 5 of this year."

""There's a total of 158 people to which must be added dozens and dozens of missing,"" Angel Victor Torres, minister in charge of cooperation with Spain's regions, told a press conference. A year's worth of rain fell in eight hours in parts of the Valencia region on Tuesday. The tragedy is already Spain's worst flood-related disaster in modern history, and meteorologists say human-driven climate change is making such extreme weather events more frequent and destructive. In 2021, at least 185 people died in heavy flooding in Germany. Prior to that, 209 people died in Romania in 1970 and floods in Portugal in 1967 killed nearly 500 people. Rescue teams on Thursday discovered the bodies of eight people, including a local policeman, who had been trapped in a garage on the outskirts of the city of Valencia, Mayor Maria Jose Catala told reporters. In the same neighbourhood of La Torre, she said, a 45-year-old woman was also found dead in her home. Thousands of people carrying bags or pushing shopping trolleys could be seen on Thursday crossing a pedestrian bridge over the Turia River from La Torre into Valencia city centre to stock up on essential supplies such as toilet paper and water. Opposition politicians accused the central government in Madrid of acting too slowly to warn residents and send in rescue teams, prompting the Interior Ministry to say regional authorities were responsible for civil protection measures. ""Those people wouldn't have died if they had been warned in time,"" Laura Villaescusa, a neighbour and manager of a local supermarket, told Reuters. Maribel Albalat, mayor of the nearby town of Paiporta, said residents were not warned of the imminent danger of flooding. She said 62 people had died in her town. ""We found a lot of elderly people inside their homes and people who went to get their cars. It was a trap,"" she told TVE. In Godelleta, a town 37 km (23 miles) west of Valencia city, Antonio Molina, 52, described how he survived by clinging to a pillar on a neighbour's porch on Tuesday as water reached his neck. Molina's home suffered two major floods in 2018 and 2020 and he blamed authorities for allowing construction of residential buildings in depressions where water accumulates. ""We don't want to live here anymore,"" he said, tearfully. ""As soon as we get a couple of raindrops, we're already checking our phones."" The floods have battered Valencia's infrastructure, sweeping away bridges, roads and rail tracks, and submerged farmland in a region that produces about two-thirds of Spain's citrus crops like oranges, which the country exports globally. About 80 km (50 miles) of roads in the eastern region were seriously damaged or impassable, said Transport Minister Oscar Puente. Many were blocked by abandoned cars. ""Unfortunately, there are dead bodies in some vehicles,"" Puente told reporters, adding that it would take two to three weeks to re-establish the high-speed train connection between Valencia and Madrid. Visiting a rescue coordination centre near Valencia city, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged people to stay at home due to the threat of more stormy weather. ""Right now, the most important thing is to safeguard as many lives as possible,"" he told reporters. In the hard-hit rural town of Utiel, some 85 km (53 miles) inland, the Magro River burst its banks, sending up to three metres (9.8 feet) of water into the mostly single-storey homes. Utiel's mayor, Ricardo Gabaldon, said at least six people died in the town of about 12,000, most of them elderly or disabled people who were unable to clamber to safety. Residents used water pumps carried on tractors as they started to clean up on Thursday, with children helping to sweep the sidewalks. Ruined household appliances and furniture were piled up in the middle of roads, and elderly people struggled to walk in the slippery, mud-coated streets. Pope Francis said he was praying for the people of the region. ""I'm close to them in this moment of catastrophe,"" he said in a video posted on X. Research group Climate Central said in a report on Thursday that a low-pressure system behind Spain's floods had tapped into an “atmospheric river” carrying excess moisture from the unusually warm Tropical Atlantic. According to its Climate Shift Index: Ocean, human-caused climate change has made these elevated sea surface temperatures at least 50 to 300 times more likely."
"543","International","What caused deadly floods in Spain? The impact of DANA explained","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323291-what-caused-deadly-floods-in-spain-the-impact-of-dana-explained","Catastrophic flash floods that have killed at least 72 people in Spain are caused by a destructive weather system in which cold and warm air meet and produce powerful rain clouds, a pattern believed to be growing more frequent due to climate change. The phenomenon is known locally as DANA, a Spanish acronym for high-altitude isolated depression, and unlike common storms or squalls it can form independently of polar or subtropical jet streams. When cold air blows over warm Mediterranean waters it causes hotter air to rise quickly and form dense, water-laden clouds that can remain over the same area for many hours, raising their destructive potential. The event sometimes provokes large hail storms and tornadoes as seen this week, meteorologists say. Eastern and Southern Spain are particularly susceptible to the phenomenon due to its position between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Warm, humid air masses and cold fronts meet in a region where mountains favour the formation of storm clouds and rainfall. This week's DANA was one of the three most intense such storms in the last century in the Valencia region, Ruben del Campo, spokesperson for the national weather agency Aemet, said. ""Forecasts were in line with what happened. But in an area between Utiel and Chiva, in the province of Valencia, rainfall exceeded 300 litres per square meter. In that area, storm systems formed and regenerated continuously,"" he explained. 'FINGERPRINTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE' While experts say it will take time to analyse all the data to determine if this particular DANA was caused by climate change, most agree that an increase in temperature of the Mediterranean and warmer and more humid atmospheric conditions contribute to producing more frequent extreme episodes. ""We're going to see more of these flash floods in the future. This has the fingerprints of climate change on it, these terribly heavy rainfalls, and these devastating floods,"" said Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading. She said even early warnings of heavy rain based on reliable forecasts did little to prevent the fatalities and people needed to understand the real danger. ""Just telling people that it's going to rain quite a lot, it's not good enough...We could see that people were putting themselves at risk driving in floodwaters, and there was just so much water that it has overwhelmed these places."" Before the term DANA was coined in the early 2000s, any heavy rainfall in the autumn, characteristic of the Mediterranean climate, used to go by the popular name ""gota fria"" (cold drop) in Spain and parts of France. The term is still widely used colloquially. Its origin dates back to 1886 when German scientists introduced the idea of ""kaltlufttropfen"", or cold air drop, to describe high altitude disturbance but without apparent reflection on the surface. Aemet says the concept of cold drop is outdated and defines DANA as a closed high-altitude depression that has become isolated and separated from an associated jet stream. Aemet says DANAs sometimes become stationary or even move backwards, from east to west."

The North Korea deployment is fanning Western concerns that the 2-1/2-year conflict in Ukraine could widen, even as attention shifts to the Middle East. It could signal how Russia hopes to offset mounting battlefield losses and continue making slow, steady gains in eastern Ukraine. ""The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security,"" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters after talks with a South Korean delegation about the North Korean deployments. U.S. President Joe Biden said the development was ""very dangerous."" The Pentagon estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday. ""A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk Oblast near the border with Ukraine,"" said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, using a term for a Russian region. The Kremlin had initially dismissed reports about a North Korean deployment as ""fake news"". But Putin on Thursday did not deny North Korean troops were in Russia and said it was Moscow's business how to implement a partnership treaty with Pyongyang. The Russian leader also said over the weekend that Moscow will respond accordingly if the U.S. and its allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia, with Moscow seeing the West's potential approval as ""direct involvement of NATO"" into the war. The United States, however, has given no indication that it will approve Ukraine's deep strike request. A North Korean foreign ministry official did not confirm media reports about a troop deployment to Russia but said if Pyongyang had taken such action, he believed it would be in line with international norms. Ukrainian military intelligence said on Thursday that the first North Korean units had been recorded in the Kursk border region, where Ukrainian troops have been operating since staging a major incursion in August. But the Pentagon declined to confirm that North Korean forces were already in Kursk. ""It is likely that they are moving in that direction towards Kursk. But I don't have more details just yet,"" Singh said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the move was an escalation by Russia. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv had been warning about the deployment for weeks, and accused allies of failing to deliver a strong response. ""The bottom line: listen to Ukraine. The solution: lift restrictions on our long-range strikes against Russia now,"" he said on X. Since their leaders met in Russia's Far East last year, North Korea and Russia have upgraded their military ties. They met again in June to sign a comprehensive strategic partnership that includes a mutual defense pact. A flurry of bilateral visits of high-ranked officials have followed between the two countries, which share a small piece of border. North Korea's foreign minister Choe Son Hui departed Pyongyang on Monday for her second trip to Russia in six weeks. Rutte said the the deployment of North Korean troops was a sign of ""growing desperation"" on Putin's part, Rutte said. ""Over 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in Putin’s war and he is unable to sustain his assault on Ukraine without foreign support,"" Rutte said. The Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said sanctions alone would not be a sufficient response to North Korean involvement. He added that Kyiv needs ""weapons and a clear plan to prevent North Korea's expanded involvement"". ""The enemy understands strength. Our allies have this strength,"" Yermak said on X."

He noted that Israel has taken action on 12 of the 15 steps outlined in a letter from Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J Austin a month ago, which called for measures to address the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “The effect has been that of the 15 steps that we urged action on, Israel has taken action either in implementing or being in the process of implementing 12 of the 15 steps."" Blinken specified three key actions that Israel still needs to fully address: allowing displaced civilians to return to their homes, restoring commercial trucking, and extending humanitarian pauses in Gaza to allow aid to reach those in need. “And again, they have to be fully implemented, and they have to be sustained,” he added,” he added. “Even with all of these steps, the situation is so difficult and so dramatic that to fully redress it, to fully answer the needs of people, the best way to do that is to end the war,” Blinken said. He suggested that Israel “by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the goals that it set for itself, (and) the strategic goals it set for itself,” adding: “So this should be a time to end the war.” Blinken said that Israeli hostages should be safely returned home and a clear plan should be devised for Israel to withdraw from Gaza without allowing Hamas to return to administer in the enclave. “But short of ending the war, which we believe now is the time to move to that, we have to see these humanitarian steps fully implemented, sustained, and as I said, particularly with regard to pauses having more extensive pauses,” he said. Since the beginning of Israel’s offensive on Gaza on October 7, 2023, the violence has led to more than 43,700 casualties, with widespread destruction making much of the region unlivable. Israel currently faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its actions in Gaza."

The planning for the firings is at an early stage after Trump’s Nov 5 election victory and could change as Trump’s administration takes shape, said the sources, who are familiar with the Trump transition and requested anonymity to speak candidly about the plans. One of the sources questioned the feasibility of a mass firing at the Pentagon. It was also unclear if Trump himself would endorse the plan, although in the past he has railed extensively against defence leaders who have criticized him. Trump has also spoken during the campaign of firing “woke” generals and those responsible for the troubled 2021 pull-out from Afghanistan. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The second source said the incoming administration would likely focus on US military officers seen as connected to Mark Milley, Trump’s former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milley was quoted in the book War by Bob Woodward, which was published last month, calling Trump “fascist to the core” and Trump’s allies have targeted him for perceived disloyalty to the former president. “Every single person that was elevated and appointed by Milley will be gone,” the second source said. “There’s a very detailed list of everybody that was affiliated with Milley. And they will all be gone.” The Joint Chiefs of Staff include the highest ranking officers in the US military and comprise the heads of the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, National Guard and Space Force. The disclosure of plans to fire senior leaders of the US armed forces comes a day after Trump picked as his defence secretary Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and veteran who has signalled a willingness to clean house at the Pentagon. “The next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. Lots of people need to be fired,” Hegseth said in his 2024 book “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.” It is unclear if Hegseth’s lack of management experience could complicate his Senate confirmation and if a more traditional alternative for the position would carry out such sweeping dismissals. Hegseth has also taken aim at Milley’s successor, Air Force General CQ Brown, asking whether he would have got the job if he were not Black. “Was it because of his skin colour? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt - which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter,” he wrote. The first source familiar with the transition planning said Brown would be among the many officers to leave. “The chiefs of the Joint Chiefs and all the vice chiefs will be fired immediately,” the source said, before noting that this was still only early planning. Some current and former US officials have played down the possibility of such a major shake-up, saying it would be unnecessary and disruptive at a time of global turmoil with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. The first source said that it would be difficult bureaucratically to fire and replace a large swath of senior US military officials, suggesting the planning could be bluster and posturing by Trump allies. But the second source suggested the Trump camp believed the Joint Chiefs of Staff needed to shrink due to perceived bureaucratic over-reach. Such cuts could be endured in an organization the scale of the US military, the source said. “These people are not irreplaceable. They are very replaceable. And then the other thing too is there is no shortage of people that will step up,” the source said. “In World War Two, we were very rapidly appointing people in their 30s or people competent to be generals. And you know what? We won the war.”"

Ratcliffe served as the nation's top spy from late May 2020 until Trump left office in January 2021. More recently, he was co-chair of the Center for American Security, a think tank advocating Trump positions, and advised the former Republican president on national security policy during his 2024 campaign. ""I look forward to John being the first person ever to serve in both of our Nation’s highest Intelligence positions. He will be a fearless fighter for the Constitutional Rights of all Americans, while ensuring the Highest Levels of National Security, and PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,"" Trump said in a statement announcing the nomination. Ratcliffe, a former member of the House of Representatives, promised at his confirmation hearing to be DNI in May 2020 that he would provide ""objective and timely intelligence"" in the position. He also said he would closely monitor other issues like Iran's military, North Korea's nuclear weapons program and foreign interference in the US election. When Ratcliffe was confirmed as DNI in 2020 by the Republican-majority Senate, all Democratic senators voted against his nomination, citing his lack of experience and partisanship. With Republicans again controlling the chamber next year, and months of experience as DNI, he is expected to be easily approved this time. More recently, Ratcliffe has criticized how Democratic President Joe Biden's administration has approached the conflict in the Middle East. In an article published in June, he argued that Biden's threat to withhold weapons shipments to Israel over its military actions in Gaza had put a key ally at risk. He also argued that the administration had not been tough enough on Iran. Ratcliffe also positioned himself as a China hawk during his tenure as DNI. ""The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the US and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,"" Ratcliffe wrote in a December 2020 article in the Wall Street Journal. As DNI, Democrats and former intelligence officials accused him of declassifying intelligence to benefit Trump and his Republican allies. They claimed he used this information to attack political opponents, including Biden, then Trump's rival for the presidency. Ratcliffe's office denied this charge. It was the second time Trump nominated Ratcliffe for the post. He was the most junior member of the House Intelligence Committee, with just six months on the panel, when Trump first said he wanted to appoint him in July 2019. Trump quickly abandoned Ratcliffe's first nomination when members of Congress worried he was too inexperienced and too partisan. But Republicans supported Ratcliffe when Trump picked him again, saying the office of DNI was too important to be filled with only acting officials. Ratcliffe had represented a Texas congressional district since 2015 and served on the House intelligence and judiciary committees. He became known as an outspoken defender of Trump during the Democratic-led proceedings that resulted in Trump's 2019 impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Republican-led Senate later acquitted Trump, the only US president to be impeached twice. Trump has had a rocky relationship with intelligence agencies, including the CIA, accusing their employees of being part of the ""deep state,"" his term for career federal employees he accuses of pursuing their own agendas."
"548","International","Trump names anti-'woke' Fox News host Hegseth as defence secy","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323905-trump-names-anti-woke-fox-news-host-hegseth-as-defence-secy","US President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday he has picked as his secretary of defence Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and veteran who has expressed disdain for the so-called “woke” policies of Pentagon leaders including its top military officer. Hegseth, if confirmed by the US Senate, could make good on Trump's campaign promises to rid the US military of generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies on diversity in the ranks that conservatives have rallied against. It could also set up a collision course between Hegseth and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General CQ Brown, a former fighter pilot with command experience in the Pacific and the Middle East, who Hegseth accused of “pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians.” The 44-year-old NATO sceptic is perhaps Trump's most surprising pick as he fills out his cabinet ahead of the Jan 20 inauguration, and the decision drew swift condemnation from some of Trump's opponents. “The job of Secretary of Defence should not be an entry-level position,” Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said on X. Trump, announcing his decision, praised Hegseth, who is an Army National Guard veteran and according to his website served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. “Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,” Trump said in a statement. “With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down.” While Hegseth has articulated only limited policy positions in the past, he has railed against NATO allies for being weak and said that China is on the verge of dominating its neighbours. Hegseth has said he left the military in 2021 after being sidelined for his political and religious views by an Army that didn't want him any more. “The feeling was mutual - I didn't want this Army any more either,” Hegseth said in his book “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.” There is already anxiety in the Pentagon that Trump aims to root out military officers and career civil servants he perceives to be disloyal. Culture war issues could be a trigger for firings. Trump told Fox News in June he would fire generals he described as “woke,” a term for those focused on racial and social justice but which is used by conservatives to disparage progressive policies. Hegseth could be an advocate for such firings. “The next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. Lots of people need to be fired,” he wrote in his book. Hegseth also took aim at Brown in particular, asking whether he would have gotten the job if he were not Black. “Was it because of his skin colour? Or his skill? We'll never know, but always doubt - which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn't really much matter,” he wrote. Trump's former US generals and defence secretaries are among his fiercest critics, with some declaring him unfit for office. Trump has suggested that his former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, could be executed for treason. Hegseth has also slammed Milley for failing to execute Trump's policies dutifully when in office and accusing him of being “a partisan to the end” to aid Democrats. Hegseth has been sharply critical of America's European allies and his selection could fuel even greater anxiety in NATO about what a Trump administration will mean for the alliance. “Outdated, outgunned, invaded, and impotent. Why should America, the European 'emergency contact number' for the past century, listen to self-righteous and impotent nations asking us to honour outdated and one-sided defence arrangements they no longer live up to?” Hegseth wrote in his book. “Maybe if NATO countries actually ponied up for their own defence — but they don't. They just yell about the rules while gutting their militaries and yelling at America for help.” In appearances on podcasts and television he has said China is building a military “specifically dedicated to defeating the United States of America.” “They have a full spectrum long-term view of not just regional but global domination, and we are we have our heads up our asses,” Hegseth said on a podcast last week. During the same appearance, Hegseth said Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine appeared to be “Putin's give-me-my-shit-back war.” Trump has been critical of President Joe Biden's assistance for Ukraine, fuelling concern about the future of support for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government under a Republican-controlled White House, Senate and possibly House of Representatives. “If Ukraine can defend themselves... great, but I don't want American intervention driving deep into Europe and making (Putin) feel like he's so much on his heels,” Hegseth said."

Trump said in a statement that Musk and Ramaswamy ""will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies."" Trump said the new department will realize long-held Republican dreams and ""provide advice and guidance from outside of government,"" signalling the Musk and Ramaswamy roles would be informal, without requiring Senate approval and allowing Musk to remain the head of electric car company Tesla, social media platform X and rocket company SpaceX. The new department would work with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to ""drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach"" to government never seen before, Trump said. The work would conclude by July 4, 2026 - the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world, already stood to benefit from Trump's victory, with the billionaire entrepreneur expected to wield extraordinary influence to help his companies and secure favourable government treatment. With many links to Washington, Musk gave millions of dollars to support Trump's presidential campaign and made public appearances with him. Adding a government portfolio to Musk's plate could benefit the market value of his companies and favoured businesses such as artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. ""It's clear that Musk will have a massive role in the Trump White House with his increasing reach clearly across many federal agencies,"" equities analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a research note. ""We believe the major benefits for Musk and Tesla far outweigh any negatives as this continues to be a 'poker move for the ages' by Musk betting on Trump,"" Ives said. The move was criticized by Public Citizen, a progressive consumer tights NGO that challenged several of Trump’s first-term policies. ""Musk not only knows nothing about government efficiency and regulation, his own businesses have regularly run afoul of the very rules he will be in position to attack in his new ‘czar’ position,"" Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, said in a statement.

""We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining,"" Musk said. Musk said at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in October that the federal budget could be reduced by ""at least"" $2 trillion. Discretionary spending, including defence spending, is estimated to total $1.9 trillion out of $6.75 trillion in total federal outlays for fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office. ""Your money is being wasted and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that. We're going to get the government off you back and out of your pocketbook,"" Musk said at the rally.

Ramaswamy is the founder of a pharmaceutical company who ran for the Republican presidential nomination against Trump and then threw his support behind the former president after dropping out.

The suspect, identified by his surname Fan, reportedly suffered self-inflicted knife wounds in his vehicle after the attack and is currently in a coma, according to police. Zhuhai police described the incident as a “serious and vicious attack,” clarifying that while the injuries to the 43 individuals are non-life-threatening, the death toll remains high. Fan, who is under medical care, sustained injuries to his neck and other body parts, preventing immediate interrogation, law enforcement officials added. According to an initial police investigation, the attack was allegedly motivated by the suspect’s dissatisfaction over the division of marital property following his divorce.Authorities are working on gathering further information to confirm the motives behind this tragic incident. Video footage verified by Reuters shows the chaotic aftermath, with at least 20 people lying on the ground and distressing cries of “terrorist” echoing as ambulances arrived to provide aid. In response to the tragedy, Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered full-scale medical support for the injured and called for strict punishment against the assailant. The central government has also dispatched a specialized team to oversee the case proceedings, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The attack has rattled Zhuhai, a city known for its typically low crime rate, and sparked renewed public concern over security in public spaces across China. Although violent crime is rare in the country, with strict laws on firearms, a spate of recent knife attacks has raised alarm.In October, a knife-wielding assailant injured five people near a primary school in Beijing, while in September, a Japanese student was fatally stabbed outside his school in Shenzhen. Another knife attack in Jilin province in June left four American university teachers injured alongside a Chinese bystander. The Zhuhai attack occurred amid the city’s hosting of China’s annual air show, where the country's new stealth fighter jet is making its debut, adding to the shock of the tragedy as the region prepared for a week of celebrations and displays of national pride."

In his opening remarks, Shehbaz welcomed participants and underscored the severe impact of climate change on developing countries, which often lack the resources to combat environmental threats effectively. Drawing from Pakistan’s experience with devastating floods in recent years, he emphasized that Pakistan understands the critical climate challenges faced by other developing countries. The PM called on the global community to adhere to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principles. He stressed that achieving meaningful results requires commitment from developed nations to provide necessary support, especially by establishing specialized climate funds.  According to Shehbaz, developing countries will need approximately $6.8 trillion by 2030 to mitigate and adapt to climate change. He urged developed nations to actively assist in promoting eco-friendly energy sources, which could offer sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels and benefit vulnerable economies. He further emphasized that addressing the climate crisis is a shared responsibility and requires a strong partnership between developed and developing countries. The conference, hosted by Pakistan, served as a platform for representatives of developing nations to voice their financial and environmental concerns, appealing for greater cooperation to meet ambitious climate targets. Earlier, Shehbaz Sharif joined world leaders at the COP29 Summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, where environmental challenges and climate change solutions are at the forefront. During the opening ceremony, Prime Minister Shehbaz had informal discussions with several world leaders, focusing on collaborative efforts for environmental protection. براہِ راست: وزیراعظم محمد شہباز شریف کی کوپ 29 کے موقع پر عالمی رہنماؤں سے ملاقات۔ https://t.co/yNtj23ByJy  The PM met with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss matters of mutual interest, including cooperative efforts on climate change.

Under the Nehru-Liaquat Pact, a bilateral agreement from April 8, 1950, about 3,000 Sikh pilgrims are permitted to visit Sikh shrines in Pakistan on four major occasions, including Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary, Guru Arjan Dev’s martyrdom day, Baisakhi (the foundation day of the Khalsa Panth), and Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s death anniversary. However, on Saturday, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) President Harjinder Singh Dhami expressed concern, noting that 65% of the visas requested by the SGPC were denied. He reported that the SGPC had submitted 2,244 passports to the Pakistan High Commission, but 1,481 pilgrims were not granted visas. Dhami urged both governments to address this issue. The Sikh jatha is scheduled to depart for Pakistan on November 14 through the Attari-Wagah border, participating in celebrations on November 15 at Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak. During the 10-day pilgrimage, the group will also visit other prominent gurdwaras, including Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Hasan Abdal, Gurdwara Dehra Sahib in Lahore, and Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur.

Rubio was arguably the most hawkish option on Trump's shortlist for secretary of state, and he has in past years advocated for a muscular foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, including China, Iran and Cuba. Over the last several years he has softened some of his stances to align more closely with Trump's views. The president-elect accuses past U.S. presidents of leading America into costly and futile wars and has pushed for a more restrained foreign policy. While the famously mercurial Trump could always change his mind at the last minute, he appeared to have settled on his pick as of Monday, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Representatives for Trump and Rubio did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The new administration will confront a world more volatile and dangerous than it was when Trump took office in 2017, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East and China aligning itself more closely with U.S. foes Russia and Iran. The Ukraine crisis will be high on Rubio's agenda. Rubio, 53, has said in recent interviews that Ukraine needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Russia rather than focus on regaining all territory that Russia has taken in the last decade. He was also one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a $95 billion military aid package for Ukraine, passed in April. While Rubio was far from the most isolationist option, his likely selection nonetheless underlines a broad shift in Republican foreign policy views under Trump. Once the party of hawks who advocated military intervention and a muscular foreign policy, most of Trump's allies now preach restraint, particularly in Europe, where many Republicans complain U.S. allies are not paying their fair share on defense. ""I'm not on Russia's side — but unfortunately the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement,"" Rubio told NBC in September. Rubio's selection holds domestic as well as international significance. Trump beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election in part by winning over large numbers of Latinos, who had voted overwhelmingly for Democrats in previous election cycles but have become an increasingly diverse demographic in a political sense, with more and more Latinos voting Republican. By selecting Rubio for a key policy role, Trump may help consolidate electoral gains among Latinos and make clear that they have a place at the highest levels of his administration. If confirmed, Rubio will likely place a much greater importance on Latin America than any previous secretary of state, said Mauricio Claver-Carone, a Rubio ally, former president of the Inter-American Development Bank and a former National Security Council aide on Latin America in the first Trump administration. ""This is the time Latin America will most be on the map in the history of any U.S. presidency. It's historic. There's no other way to say it,"" said Claver-Carone. CHINA, CUBA HAWK Rubio was one of three final contenders for Trump's vice-presidential pick. The president-elect ultimately chose U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, a hard-right figure who is known for his isolationist foreign policy positions. Some of Trump's supporters will be skeptical of his decision to tap Rubio, who until recently held muscular foreign policy positions that contradict those of Trump. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, for instance, Rubio co-sponsored legislation that would make it harder for Trump to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, by requiring two thirds of the Senate to ratify withdrawal. Trump has railed for years against NATO member countries that failed to meet agreed military spending targets and warned during the campaign that he would not only refuse to defend nations ""delinquent"" on funding but would also encourage Russia ""to do whatever the hell they want"" to them. Rubio is a top China hawk in the Senate, and was sanctioned by Beijing in 2020 over his stance on Hong Kong following democracy protests. Most notably, Rubio called on the Treasury Department in 2019 to launch a national security review of popular Chinese social media app TikTok's acquisition of Musical.ly, prompting an investigation and troubled divestment order. As the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, he has also kept up the heat on the Biden administration, demanding it block all sales to Huawei earlier this year after the sanctioned Chinese tech company released a new laptop powered by an Intel AI processor chip. Rubio, whose grandfather fled Cuba in 1962, is also an outspoken opponent of normalizing relations with the Cuban government, a position Trump shares. The head of the House subcommittee overseeing Latin American affairs, he is also a frequent and fierce critic of Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela."

His remarks came during the opening of an Arab and Muslim leaders’ summit in Riyadh on Monday. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman expressed his outrage over Israel’s ongoing aggression, urging the international community to recognize the statehood of Palestine and to take decisive action to end the violence. His call for an immediate ceasefire was echoed by prominent leaders from across the Arab and Muslim world, all of whom are gathered in Riyadh to discuss the escalating situation in Gaza and Lebanon. “Israel’s actions are a massacre against the Palestinian and Lebanese people,” MBS declared, addressing the summit with urgency. “We call on Israel to immediately cease all acts of aggression and to respect the rights of the people in Gaza and Lebanon.” The summit, attended by a wide range of regional leaders, underscored the urgency of the situation. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati arrived in Riyadh on Sunday evening to participate, while the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, also condemned Israel’s actions. Aboul Gheit expressed that “words cannot fully capture the suffering of the Palestinian people,” highlighting the dire situation faced by civilians caught in the crossfire of the conflict. The Saudi Press Agency reported that the aggression in Gaza and Lebanon had spurred Arab and Islamic leaders to take urgent action.“The key priorities for the summit include halting the aggression, protecting civilians, providing humanitarian support to the Palestinian and Lebanese people, unifying positions among Arab and Muslim states, and pressuring the international community to intervene and help end the violence,” the agency stated. Among the leaders attending the summit was Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has long advocated for the recognition of Palestinian statehood, and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Both leaders have strongly condemned Israel’s actions and are seeking greater international pressure to force an end to the conflict. While Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian was unable to attend due to “executive matters,” a phone call between him and MBS confirmed that Iran’s First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref would represent the country at the summit."

"559","International","Trump asks Putin to avoid Ukraine war escalation","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323829-trump-asks-putin-to-avoid-ukraine-war-escalation","US President-elect Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and advised him not to escalate the Ukraine war, a source familiar with the conversation told Reuters on Sunday, as President Joe Biden plans to urge Trump not to abandon Kyiv. Trump and Putin spoke in recent days, said the source. Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday. Trump has criticised the scale of US military and financial support for Kyiv, vowing to end the war quickly, without saying how. Ukraine's foreign ministry said it was not informed in advance of the call between Trump and Putin and subsequently could neither endorse or object to it. ""We do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders,"" said Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, when asked about the phone call, which was first reported by The Washington Post. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Republican Trump will take office on Jan 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov 5 presidential election. Biden has invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Biden's top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what's happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East. ""President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,"" Sullivan told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" show. Sullivan's comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war. When asked if Biden would ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred. ""I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term,"" Sullivan said. Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of US military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February of 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticised and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers. Trump insisted last year that Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the time. He told Reuters Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject and Biden has never suggested. Zelenskiy said on Thursday he was not aware of any details of Trump's plan to end the Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail major concessions for Kyiv. According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take control of the US Senate with a 52-seat majority. Control of the US House of Representatives in the next Congress is not yet clear with some votes still being counted. Republicans have won 213 seats, according to Edison Research, just shy of the 218 needed for a majority. If Republicans win both chambers, it will mean the majority of Trump's agenda will have a significantly easier time passing through Congress. Republican US Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state, criticised US funding for Ukraine in a CBS interview. ""The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation,"" Hagerty said. The 2.5-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war. Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war. Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies."

The visit, scheduled for November 11-14, will focus on strategic security matters and further deepening Russia-China cooperation amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Shoigu’s meetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are expected to address “current problems of international and regional security,” with discussions spanning a wide range of topics related to military and bilateral cooperation. The visit is part of Moscow and Beijing’s growing partnership, which has been particularly strengthened since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. Chinese President Xi Jinping has become one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most significant allies on the global stage. In addition to talks with Wang Yi, Shoigu will meet with Chen Wenqing, China’s top security official and the head of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, a powerful body within the ruling Communist Party. Shoigu, who served as Russia's defence minister during the first two years of the Ukraine conflict, was reassigned to the Security Council after facing criticism and setbacks in the Russian military campaign. His visit to China underscores the continuing importance of Moscow-Beijing relations, particularly in the realms of security and defense. "

With the addition of Arizona's 11 electoral votes, Trump now stands at 312, according to projections from major U.S. news outlets, including CNN, Fox News, and NBC. In a historic shift, Arizona, a state that supported Joe Biden in 2020, swung red in the final tally, marking a crucial flip for Trump’s campaign. The state’s results, along with a sweep of all seven battleground states, ensured Trump’s electoral victory. His win extends to key swing states, including Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin—each of which had voted for Democrats in the previous election. As the results from across the country poured in, Trump solidified his hold over more than half of the 50 states. States such as Florida (30 electoral votes), Texas (40), and Pennsylvania (19) tipped the scales in his favor, bolstering his path to victory. On the other hand, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who sought to make history as the first female president of the United States, secured 226 electoral votes. While Harris won several strongholds, including California (54 votes), New York (28 votes), and Illinois (19 votes), her path to victory was ultimately blocked by Trump’s performance in the battlegrounds. The final tally shows Trump’s victory in 31 states, while Harris secured 19 states and the District of Columbia. With the race nearing its conclusion, both campaigns continue to monitor developments as mail-in and absentee ballots are counted in some states. Below is the breakdown of the electoral votes by state: Trump (312 Electoral Votes): Harris (226 Electoral Votes): With Trump’s victory secured, attention now turns to his next steps in forming a new administration and preparing for a transition of power, while Harris and her supporters face the reality of a second-place finish in the race for the presidency."

The summit comes amid escalating violence following the October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel, which resulted in over 1,200 deaths, mostly civilians. Israel's subsequent military response has led to more than 43,600 casualties in Gaza, primarily civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The United Nations has corroborated the figures, calling the situation dire. The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported that the summit will focus on the continuing Israeli aggression in Palestinian territories and Lebanon, as well as the broader regional developments. The meeting follows a similar gathering in Riyadh last year, where the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) condemned Israeli actions in Gaza, labeling them as ""barbaric."" Key attendees include Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Sharif is expected to call for an immediate cessation of the violence in Gaza, describing the situation as a genocide and condemning Israel's ""ongoing adventurism"" in the region. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan chaired a preparatory ministerial meeting on Sunday to finalize the agenda for Monday’s summit. The meeting underscores Saudi Arabia's leadership role in rallying regional powers against Israeli actions and its efforts to bring about a political solution to the prolonged conflict. In addition to the humanitarian toll in Gaza, the violence has spilled over into southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah militants, backed by Iran, have engaged in cross-border exchanges with Israel. These hostilities escalated in late September following Israel’s intensification of airstrikes in the region."

Speaking to reporters, Asif Nazrul, the interim government’s legal advisor, emphasised that the government is determined to bring to justice those involved in the violent crackdowns during July and August, which reportedly claimed over 700 lives.""Those responsible for the indiscriminate killings during the mass uprising will be brought back from wherever they have taken refuge,"" Nazrul said. ""We will ensure they are arrested and brought to justice."" The call for a ""red notice"" from Interpol, an international alert for fugitives, is part of the government’s effort to pursue those linked to the controversial police operations under Hasina’s 15-year rule. Hasina herself, 77, is believed to have fled to India by helicopter just before her palace was overtaken by protestors. Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has already issued an arrest warrant for Hasina, who has been summoned to appear in Dhaka on November 18 to face charges of “massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity.” Mohammad Tajul Islam, the chief prosecutor of the ICT, disclosed that arrest warrants have been issued for over 60 individuals, with around 25 already in custody. Interpol, based in France, coordinates international police cooperation between 196 member countries. The red notice, however, does not obligate India—an Interpol member—to extradite Hasina. Each member country retains the discretion to enforce red notices according to its own legal framework. "

Demonstrators gathered in Valencia and other cities, voicing their outrage at what they called inadequate warnings and a delayed response to the flash floods that impacted around 80 towns and cities. In Valencia, where protesters marched to city hall, chants of “Murderers!” echoed through the streets as citizens held placards criticizing Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Valencia’s Regional President Carlos Mazon. Tensions ran high, with scuffles reported between police and demonstrators.  Citizens expressed frustration over the lack of timely alerts, some noting that warnings arrived on their phones only after the floods had already begun. Julian Garcia, a 75-year-old protester, argued that earlier alerts could have saved lives by encouraging residents to avoid traveling to work or sending children to school. The clean-up in Valencia continues, as authorities search for missing persons. Many protesters demanded accountability, with some accusing leaders of mismanagement amounting to manslaughter. Ana de la Rosa, a demonstrator, condemned the political infighting between regional and national leaders, calling for more than resignations and demanding systemic accountability. As the region battles post-flood challenges, health officials have also called on local governments to implement measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. "

The directive represents a significant shift in the Taliban's internal security management. The order effectively limits the authority of Defense Minister Yaqoob and Interior Minister Haqqani over military assets, establishing a more centralized command structure. This development comes amid concerns about weapons flowing through eastern Afghanistan's unchecked channels. The mandate appears to be triggered by regional security concerns, particularly regarding the potential misuse of abandoned US military equipment. Akhundzada's directive emphasizes strengthening internal security measures and preventing military resources from becoming cross-border security threats. The decree not only reinforces Akhundzada's control over military assets but also demonstrates the Taliban leadership's response to regional stability concerns. This centralization effort suggests an attempt to implement stricter oversight of military resources."

The COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan's capital Baku will be among the highest-profile multilateral events attended by Taliban administration officials since they took control in Kabul after 20 years of fighting NATO-backed forces. The U.N. has not allowed the Taliban to take up Afghanistan's seat at the General Assembly, and Afghanistan's government is not formally recognised by U.N. member states, largely due to the Taliban's restrictions on women's education and freedom of movement. Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said officials from the National Environmental Protection Agency had arrived in Azerbaijan to attend the COP conference. The Taliban took over the agency when they returned to power as U.S.-led forces withdrew. Taliban officials have taken part in U.N.-organised meetings on Afghanistan in Doha, and Taliban ministers have attended forums in China and Central Asia in the past two years. But the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Bureau of the COP has deferred consideration of Afghanistan’s participation since 2021, in effect freezing the country out of the talks. Afghan NGOs have also struggled to attend the climate negotiations in recent years. Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to ""potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,"" a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Because the Taliban are not formally recognised within the U.N. system as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, the source said, the officials cannot receive credentials to take part in the proceedings of full member states."

"571","International","Explainer: What is the point of a UN climate COP?","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323751-explainer-what-is-the-point-of-a-un-climate-cop","Tens of thousands of people from around the globe will gather next week for COP29, the annual U.N. climate summit, in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku. But as each year's summit has produced its own set of promises, plans and paperwork to chase, the rationale for these discussions can be hard to follow. Here's what you need to know about why COP, short for Conference of the Parties, matters: Because climate change will affect every country, regardless of whether it contributed to the problem, it demands global solutions that can address the diversity of needs across countries. In signing the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that launched the global negotiations, the parties that agreed to it took pains to differentiate between the wealthy nations that caused the bulk of warming and poorer countries that suffer disproportionately from it. Put another way, the talks are framed around the idea that the countries that benefited the most from industrialising should take the most responsibility for dealing with the warming that resulted. Addressing that imbalance has become more difficult as developing countries' economies have grown and rich nations juggle competing costs including war. The summit provides a place for countries to discuss solutions, including energy policies, financing schemes or funding needs. Nearly every summit is also attended by world leaders, giving an important signal that their countries are committed to the UNFCCC goals. The leaders' presence also helps countries hold one another accountable for past promises. But the annual COP is just the main event in a continuous process. Country representatives meet year round to build support for new climate action proposals ahead of the COP, where they can be agreed by consensus of all countries. While each summit is meant to advance global climate action from the year before, the event also offers countries a chance to show their citizens the problem is being addressed. Importantly, the exercise has seen countries counting and reporting their emissions, and has helped move hundreds of billions of dollars in climate aid to developing nations. By requiring decisions by consensus, the process also ensures strong global support for agreed actions, improving the chances these actions will be implemented. But the pace of progress has been too slow to contain the rise in global temperatures. Since COP summits began in 1995, both emissions and temperatures have continued to rise, meaning the world is on track for extreme climate change. Proponents of the UNFCCC process say there is no alternative for negotiating major socioeconomic changes to try to limit global warming. This year's summit is hoping for a few headline agreements: a new annual climate finance target, a deal to get multilateral carbon credit markets working, and more aid money pledged for countries already hit by costly climate disasters. Beyond that, negotiators will continue to work on technical agreements that build on work done at previous summits. Outside the formal COP framework, groups of countries could launch their own initiatives or pledge funding for specific projects. Companies will likely announce commercial deals related to climate action, while financiers try to raise cash for climate investments. Azerbaijan holds the presidency of COP29 this year, when the rotating COP presidency fell to Central and Eastern Europe. Next year Brazil will serve as Latin America's host for COP30. As summit host, a country works the entire year to steer pre-summit negotiations and lobby other governments for ambitious action. This gives the presidency an important part in defining the summit's priorities. Beyond the country negotiations, the COP summit offers a chance for anyone to try to draw attention - or funding - to their cause. Hundreds of side events see activists and scientists rubbing shoulders with industry lobbyists and banking heavyweights. Public-facing conference stages host panel discussions on topics from ocean acidification to designing carbon offset projects. An exhibition hall, dubbed the ""Green Zone,"" features discussions led by national delegations, non-profit organisations and corporations. While some summits have seen big organized protests, such as the rally of thousands outside of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, the last two conferences in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have allowed for protests only in designated, roped-off areas. Azerbaijan, which also has banned public protests, will likely see little civic action outside of the high-security conference site."

In a statement, the department said that Farhad Shakeri had informed law enforcement ""that he was tasked on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill"" Trump, the department said. Shakeri allegedly told law enforcement he had no plans to formulate a plan to kill Trump within the IRGC's timeline. The department described Shakeri, 51, as an IRGC asset residing in Tehran. It said he immigrated to the U.S. as a child and was deported in or about 2008 following a robbery conviction. Shakeri is at large and believed to be in Iran, the prosecutors said. Two New York residents whom Shakeri had met in prison, Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt, have also been charged for helping Shakeri plot to kill a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin in New York, described as an outspoken critic of Iran's government who had previously been targeted for murder. Prosecutors did not identify the target, but it matched the description of Masih Alinejad, a journalist and activist who has criticized Iran's head-covering laws for women. Four Iranians were charged in 2021 in connection with a plot to kidnap her, and in 2022 a man was arrested with a rifle outside her home. Rivera and Loadholt have both been ordered detained pending trial. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Local authorities have imposed a curfew in the area to maintain law and order. Police officials claim the deceased were involved in militant activities. However, Kuki tribal representatives strongly dispute this narrative, asserting that the victims were village volunteers from their community. The situation has further deteriorated with reports of six individuals, including three women and three children, going missing from the Jiribam area. Additionally, authorities discovered the bodies of two elderly individuals amid debris, showing signs of physical trauma. Kuki-majority districts have announced a strike in response to the incident. Community leaders have stated that protests will continue until law enforcement issues a public apology for the operation. Tribal representatives have also alleged that security forces assisted in the looting and burning of village properties. The incident has heightened existing tensions in the region, where minority communities have reported ongoing persecution. The area remains under strict security measures as authorities attempt to prevent any escalation of the situation. "

Slowing urban spending over the past three to four months has not only hurt the earnings of largest consumer goods firms, it has raised questions about the structural nature of India's long-term economic success. Since the end of the pandemic, India's economic growth has been driven in large part by urban consumption, however, that now seems to be changing. ""There is a top end – the people with money are spending like that is going out of style,"" Nestle India Chairman Suresh Narayanan said. ""There used to be a middle segment, which used to be the segment that most of us fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms used to operate in, which is the middle class of the country, that seems to be shrinking."" Nestle India, which makes Kit Kats and other well-known goods, reported its first quarterly revenue drop since the COVID-hit June quarter in 2020. While there is no officially defined income bracket for Indian middle class households, they are broadly estimated to account for a third of India's 1.4 billion people. They are considered a key demographic both economically and politically, with middle class frustration seen as a significant factor behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi's weaker election performance this year. Asia's third-largest economy is expected to expand 7.2% in the financial year ending March 2025, the fastest among its major peers. Belying those rosy projections, however, are signs of a sharp slowdown in the household sector. Indian urban consumption hit a two-year low this month, according to an index published by Citibank that captures indicators such as airline bookings, fuel sales and wages. ""While some of the fall could be temporary, the key macro drivers remain unfavourable,"" Citi's chief India economist Samiran Chakraborty said. Growth in inflation-adjusted wage costs for listed Indian firms - a proxy for earnings of urban Indians - has remained below 2% for all the three quarters of 2024, well below the 10-year average of 4.4%, data from Citi showed. Chakraborty cites this as a key factor impacting urban consumption, along with declining savings and tighter rules for personal loans. Headline inflation has averaged 5% over the past 12 months, but food inflation has held above 8% as weather shocks elevated prices of vegetables, cereals and other essential foods. In October, retail inflation hit a 14-month high of 6.2% while food prices jumped to 10.9%. Anecdotal data suggests retail sales rose close to 15% year-on-year during the 2024 festive season, which runs from August to November, Nomura said in a note last week, about half last year's pace. ""During this festival season, we have not spent at all,"" said Rajwanti Dahiya, 60, who survives on her husband's monthly pension of 30,000 Indian rupees ($356.76). ""Savings are low, barely there."" A 'SHRINKING' MIDDLE India's central bank expects 7.2% GDP growth for the fiscal year ending March 2025 on the back of improved rural demand and a strong services sector. Higher government investment could also support demand, said Rahul Bajoria, head of India and ASEAN economic research at Bank of America. ""If government spending kicks in, that probably does have some multiplier effects on private consumption spending as well,"" said Bajoria, who expects GDP growth at 6.8% in the current financial year. Some are less optimistic with Citi and IDFC First Bank economists expecting GDP growth in the July-September quarter to miss the central bank's projected 7%, weighed by slower urban consumption. That pessimism has hit consumer stocks with the Nifty FMCG index (.NIFTYFMCG), opens new tab declining 13% since Oct. 1, compared with a 7.4% drop in the benchmark Nifty 50 (.NSEI), opens new tab. Of the FMCG index's 15 constituent firms, only one reported a pickup in sales volume growth in the September quarter. Consumers in large cities are swapping branded items from hair oil to tea for cheaper unbranded alternatives, reflected in the first sales volume decline in 11 quarters for the foods and refreshment group at Hindustan Unilever. ""We see the growth in big city standing down, although in smaller cities and in rural the growth continues to be good,"" Hindustan Unilever chief executive Rohit Jawa said last month, after reporting lower than expected earnings. Consumers are also cutting back on dining out. Fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut and KFC posted same-store sales declines, earnings showed. While people are still coming, they are choosing cheaper meals, Rajeev Varman, CEO at Burger King operator Restaurant Brands Asia (RESR.NS), opens new tab said after posting a 3% drop in quarterly same-store sales. ""We prefer budget-friendly stores that give good deals and discounts to manage our monthly expenditure,"" said 37-year old Avinash Crasto, a Mumbai marketing and sales executive who has a family of four and identifies as middle class.

The development marks another chapter in the ongoing ethnic tensions plaguing the northeastern state. The Kuki Zo Council has alleged that Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel conducted fake encounters, resulting in the deaths of their community members. In response to these fatalities, tribal groups announced a shutdown across Manipur from 5 AM to 6 PM. According to tribal representatives, the deceased individuals were unarmed, contradicting official claims about their involvement in aggressive actions. The situation has further deteriorated with reports of five individuals going missing from a Kuki relief camp located within a police station compound, with family members claiming they were killed in custody. Local officials have acknowledged the disappearances from the relief camp and initiated an investigation into the matter. These incidents have intensified the existing ethnic conflicts in Manipur, with tribal leaders now advocating for a separate state. The violence in Manipur continues to claim lives despite administrative measures, highlighting the challenges in maintaining peace in the region. The state has witnessed numerous such incidents since the outbreak of ethnic clashes."

However, on Saturday, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) President Harjinder Singh Dhami expressed concern, noting that 65% of the visas requested by the SGPC were denied. He reported that the SGPC had submitted 2,244 passports to the Pakistan High Commission, but 1,481 pilgrims were not granted visas. Dhami urged both governments to address this issue. The Sikh jatha is scheduled to depart for Pakistan on November 14 through the Attari-Wagah border, participating in celebrations on November 15 at Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak. During the 10-day pilgrimage, the group will also visit other prominent gurdwaras, including Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Hasan Abdal, Gurdwara Dehra Sahib in Lahore, and Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur.

The decision comes after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, leading to a significant increase in terrorist activities across the region, particularly in neighboring countries. Iranian officials have voiced concerns about the resurgence and support of various terrorist organizations within Afghanistan, including ISIS-K (Islamic State Khorasan Province). These groups have been linked to several attacks on Iranian soil, prompting the Iranian government to take decisive action. The wall, which is estimated to cost $3 billion, is part of Iran's broader strategy to enhance national security by curbing the infiltration of terrorists, drug trafficking, and illegal immigration. Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Reza Ashtiani emphasized that the presence of these terrorist groups in Afghanistan poses a severe threat to regional stability. The project is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Iranian authorities believe that sealing the border will significantly reduce the cross-border terrorist activities and smuggling operations that have intensified since the Taliban’s rise to power."

The World Bank has warned that unemployment rates in the country have reached dangerous levels. Afghanistan is currently facing a trade deficit of $3.5 billion, primarily due to decreased exports and increased imports, according to the World Bank. The Taliban regime has also refused to pay pensions to retired employees, further exacerbating the economic crisis. Recent protests have erupted in Afghanistan over the non-payment of pensions to former government employees. Some ex-government workers report being forced to beg due to poverty, with many struggling to afford necessities like rent. The Taliban's financial difficulties have contributed to the overall economic decline. The situation has led to increased poverty and hardship for many Afghans, particularly those who previously worked in government sectors.

The Taliban has reportedly silenced opposition voices and implemented measures to maintain their rule. This includes imprisoning or killing former government officials and prosecutors. They have also released convicted terrorists from prisons while detaining members of the previous administration. Women's rights have been particularly affected under Taliban rule. In 2021, the Taliban annulled all divorce decrees, effectively stripping women of their right to divorce. International reports also allege that women have been subjected to violence and abuse in Taliban-controlled prisons, with some cases resulting in deaths.

This unprecedented move, intended to secure the airspace amid escalating tensions, affects civilian, commercial, and non-operational military flights until at least Saturday morning. While Iran initially announced a reopening at 9am, the closure has since been extended indefinitely. The Israeli strikes, which targeted key military sites across Iran, sparked an immediate response on Iranian social media, with users expressing concerns over possible further actions by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Images shared online showed passengers disembarking from grounded flights in Iranian airports, underscoring the disruption’s impact on regional air travel and the substantial financial losses incurred by airlines. Flight data highlights that the distance from Israel to Tehran is roughly 1,600 kilometres. With speeds reaching up to 2,400km/h (Mach 2.0) for an F-16 and 1,931 km/h (Mach 1.6) for an F-35 at high altitude, the estimated flight time from Tehran back to Israeli airspace is around 50 minutes.

Hours later the Israeli military said its strikes had been completed and its objectives achieved, but a semi-official Iranian news agency vowed a ""proportional reaction"" to Israeli moves against Tehran. Iranian media reported multiple explosions over several hours in the capital and at nearby military bases, starting shortly after 2am (2230 GMT on Friday). Before dawn, Israel's public broadcaster said three waves of strikes had been completed and that the operation was over. Iran said its air defence system successfully countered Israel's attacks on military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam with ""limited damage"" to some locations. The Middle East has been on edge awaiting Israel's retaliation for a ballistic-missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct 1, in which around 200 missiles were fired at Israel and one person was killed in the West Bank.  Tensions between arch rivals Israel and Iran have escalated since Hamas, the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group based in Gaza, attacked Israel on Oct 7, 2023. Hamas has been supported by Lebanon-based Hezbollah militants, also backed by Iran. Fears that Iran and the US would be drawn into a regional war have risen with Israel's intensifying assault on Hezbollah since last month, including airstrikes on the Lebanese capital Beirut and a ground operation, as well as its year-old war in Gaza. ""In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,"" Israel's military said in a statement announcing the attack. The military said later it had completed its ""targeted"" attacks in Iran, striking truck missile manufacturing facilities and surface-to-aerial equipment, adding its planes had safely returned home. ""If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond,"" the military said. Targets did not include energy infrastructure or Iran's nuclear facilities, a U.S. official said. US President Joe Biden had warned that Washington, Israel's main backer and supplier of arms, would not support a strike on Tehran's nuclear sites and has said Israel should consider alternatives to attacking Iran's oil fields. Iranian authorities have repeatedly warned Israel against any attack. ""Iran reserves the right to respond to any aggression, and there is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency said on Saturday, citing sources. A senior Biden official said Israel's ""targeted and proportional strikes"" should be the end of direct exchange of fire between the two countries, but the US was fully prepared to once again defend Israel if Iran should choose to respond. The US has multiple direct and indirect channels of communication with Iran where it has made its position clear, the official said on condition of anonymity. Videos carried by Iranian media showed air defences continuously firing at apparently incoming projectiles in central Tehran, without saying which sites were coming under attack. The semi-official Tasnim news agency said Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps bases that were attacked were not damaged. A spokesperson for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization said flights on all routes were cancelled until further notice, state news agency IRNA reported. Neighbouring Iraq also suspended all flights until further notice, its state news agency said. Israel targeted some military sites in Syria's central and southern parts with airstrikes early on Saturday, Syrian state news agency SANA reported. Israel has not confirmed striking Syria. Israel said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and other security officials had closely followed the operation at the military's command and control centre in Tel Aviv. Gallant spoke to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shortly after Israel's strikes began. Austin emphasized the enhanced force posture of the United States to defend US personnel, Israel and its partners across the region, the Pentagon said. Israel notified the United States before its strikes, but Washington was not involved in the operation, a US official told Reuters. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in the Middle East for another attempt to broker a peace deal, said on Wednesday Israel's retaliation should not lead to greater escalation. Even as it sought to convince Israel to calibrate its strikes, the United States moved to reassure its closest ally in the Middle East that it would aid in its defence should Tehran decide to stage a counter-attack. This included Biden's decision to move the US military's THAAD anti-missile defences to Israel, along with about 100 US soldiers to operate them."

Those killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and engineer Mohamed Reda of the pro-Iranian news outlet Al-Mayadeen and camera operator Wissam Qassem, who worked for Hezbollah's Al-Manar, the outlets said in separate statements. The strikes made it the deadliest day for media in a year of hostilities between the Israeli military and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which in general denies deliberately attacking journalists. Five journalists had been killed in previous Israeli strikes in Lebanon during the conflict, including Reuters visual journalist Issam Abdallah. Hasbaya is a town inhabited by both Muslims and Christians. There have been attacks on its outskirts in recent weeks, but Friday's, at around 3 a.m. (midnight GMT), was the first on the town itself. ""This is a war crime,"" Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary said. At least 18 journalists from six media outlets, including Sky News, Al-Jazeera and Lebanese broadcasters, were staying at the guesthouses. ""We heard the airplane flying very low - that's what woke us up - and then we heard the two missiles,"" Muhammad Farhat, a reporter with the Lebanese outlet Al-Jadeed, told Reuters. He said several bungalows had been damaged. His footage showed overturned and damaged cars, some marked ""Press"". ""We had been reporting from there for about a month without anything happening. I don't even know how I climbed out from under the rubble,"" Farhat said. Ghassan bin Jiddo, the director of Al-Mayadeen, said on the channel's X account that the attack was ""deliberate"". ""We hold the occupation (Israel) fully responsible for this war crime, in which journalist crews including the Al-Mayadeen team were targeted,"" bin Jiddo said. ISRAEL ATTACKS LEBANESE MEDIA AND SOLDIERS A day earlier, Israel had struck an office used by Al-Mayadeen in Beirut's southern suburbs. Lebanon’s health ministry said one person had been killed and five others, including a child, wounded. Beirut authorities say the Israeli military campaign has killed more than 2,500 people and displaced more than 1.2 million people, creating a humanitarian crisis. On Thursday, an Israeli strike killed three Lebanese soldiers as they tried to evacuate wounded people from the border village of Yater, the Lebanese army said. There was no comment from the Israeli military. The U.S. has said Israel should take steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger U.N. peacekeepers or Lebanese army troops in its attacks in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel, which has been criticised for shelling hospitals and schools, has said it targets Hamas and Hezbollah militants precisely, accusing them of using civilians as shields. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that, as of Oct. 24, its preliminary investigations showed at least 128 media workers had been killed since the start of the Gaza war, making it the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992. Of those, 123 were Palestinian, two Israeli and three Lebanese. A month into Israel's military operation against the Iran-backed Hezbollah, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned in Doha that ""this cannot lead, should not lead, to a protracted campaign"". Blinken also said he hoped Iran was getting the message that further attacks on Israel would put its own interests at risk. Israel has vowed retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on Oct. 1. US, ISRAEL, QATAR AND EGYPT TRY TO REVIVE CEASEFIRE TALKS U.S. and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha to prepare for new talks on a Gaza ceasefire that would also entail the release of Israeli hostages, Qatar and Washington said. Israel said David Barnea, head of the Mossad intelligence agency, would travel to Doha on Sunday to meet with CIA director William Burns and Qatar's prime minister. An Egyptian security delegation met a delegation of Hamas leaders in Cairo as part of the efforts to revive Gaza ceasefire talks, Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV said. Hamas senior official Osama Hamdan told Al-Mayadeen there was no change in the group's position. ""The hostages held by the resistance will only return with a stop to the aggression and complete withdrawal,"" Hamdan said. Blinken is on his first trip to the region since Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered conflict across the Middle East. Washington, Israel's close ally, has expressed hope that his death can provide an impetus for an end to the fighting. Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, the head of Israel's military, has said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah now looks possible as Israel has killed most of its senior commanders. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati said the onus was on Israel. ""The storm we are currently witnessing ... carries the seeds of total destruction, not only for our country, but for all human values,"" he said. Hezbollah launched attacks against Israel a day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 assault on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being abducted, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's Gaza offensive has killed nearly 43,000 people, according to Gaza authorities, and laid waste to the territory. "

According to the latest UN data, at least 75,000 people were displaced between October 5 and 15 in Gaza, mostly within the north. However, promises by Israel and its enemies Hamas and Hezbollah to keep fighting have chilled hopes that the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Wednesday might lead to truces in Gaza and Lebanon and prevent further escalation in the Middle East. The United States would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around Beirut, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday to address various issues, including the escalating conflict in the Middle East. The two leaders agreed that de-escalation and a ceasefire are crucial to prevent the conflict from spreading further. Also on Saturday, defense ministers of the Group of Seven countries expressed concerns over the escalating tensions in the Middle East. In a joint statement issued at their first summit of this year in the southern Italian city of Naples, the ministers said they were worried about ""escalation"" in the Middle East after Israeli attacks on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). ""We express concern about all the threats to the security of UNIFIL,"" the statement said. ""The protection of peacekeepers is incumbent upon all parties to a conflict."" They all back a ""significant and sustained increase"" in humanitarian aid to Gaza and a sustainable pathway to a two-state solution. "
"589","International","Netanyahu faces pressure to end Gaza war after Sinwar's killing","https://www.samaa.tv/2087322671-netanyahu-faces-pressure-to-end-gaza-war-after-sinwar-s-killing","The killing of Israel's most wanted enemy Yahya Sinwar has been hailed as vindication for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but in a country weary after a year of war it also raises pressure on him to end the fighting and save the hostages still in Gaza. Netanyahu himself described Sinwar's death as ""the beginning of the end"" to a conflict that has spread to Lebanon and Yemen, and said it could end if Hamas lays down its arms and return the 101 Israeli and foreign hostages held in Gaza. With Sinwar joining a growing list of Palestinian and Lebanese militant leaders killed by Israel over recent months, the fear that a deal would reward the architect of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel has gone. ""I think what we have now is an opportunity to use this moment in Gaza to close the front in Gaza,"" said Shira Efron, Senior Director of Policy Research at the pro-Israel Diane and Guilford Glazer Foundation. ""I mean, you need to remember that this goes into the kishka (the guts) of Israeli society, they've avenged the mastermind Sinwar,"" she said. Yet it remains unclear how Hamas will respond to the death of their leader, filmed by an Israeli drone sitting badly wounded in a ruined building in Gaza before his body was recovered and taken to Israel for tests that confirmed his identity. On Friday, the deputy head of Hamas Khalil Al-Hayya said Israeli hostages would not be returned until Israeli ""aggression"" ended and its forces withdrew. Some of Netanyahu's hardline political allies, including his Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, said Israel should not stop before the ""complete surrender"" of Hamas. But with the White House talking about a potential ""inflection point"" in the war, even many supporters of Israel's hitherto uncompromising approach said there was an opportunity to end the fighting. ""I think Netanyahu said the right thing last night. Give us the hostages and - when everyone, the hostages, will return - we'll leave,"" said Erez Goldman, a Jerusalem resident, as he absorbed the news the following day. A significant section of Israeli opinion, including Netanyahu, has always maintained that the only way to achieve peace is by inflicting military defeats on their enemies, even if that comes at the cost of upsetting their allies. Sinwar's death was seen by many as vindication of Israel's refusal to bow to international pressure earlier this year not to send ground troops into the city of Rafah, which was at the time the refuge for more than a million Palestinians displaced by the fighting. ""This is the first thing that came to mind when Sinwar was taken out in Rafah,"" one senior official said on Friday. Netanyahu has resisted pressure for months from families of the hostages and from world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, to agree a ceasefire deal in Gaza. There were more such calls on Friday. Netanyahu's political fortunes, at rock-bottom last year in the aftermath of the bloodiest day in Israel's history, have revived steadily since, particularly as a series of militant leaders have been assassinated. Mohammed Deif, Hamas' longstanding military commander, was killed in Gaza in July and in the same month, the movement's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. Two months later Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in Beirut, one of a string of leaders from the Iranian-backed group killed in a wave of Israeli airstrikes. The addition of Sinwar to the list could give Netanyahu a potential ""off-ramp"" from Gaza, said Carmiel Arbit, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""But Sinwar's death alone does not guarantee the circumstances necessary for Netanyahu to declare an end to the war as so many hope,"" she said. Hostage families feel that after ceasefire talks apparently ran into the sand weeks ago, there is no time to waste. ""It's an opportunity that we might not have again,"" said Daniel Lifshitz, whose grandfather Oded Lifshitz is still held in Gaza. Much will depend on who succeeds Sinwar, whose death in combat was hailed by many Palestinians as a heroic act of defiance against Israel that should inspire further resistance. Israel has said it must maintain security control over Gaza when combat operations end. But it has otherwise not revealed any detailed ideas for running the enclave beyond rejecting any role for Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. After a year of war, the enclave is in ruins, with more than 42,000 Palestinians dead and most of the population displaced. Reconstruction will take years, requiring billions of dollars and heavy international support. On the Israeli side, after Hamas-led gunmen stormed into Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, few are willing to trust Hamas even if Sinwar is gone. But even the chairperson of Kibbutz Be'eri, a community close to the Gaza Strip that lost one in 10 of its population on Oct 7, said the chance offered by Sinwar's death should be taken. ""There is an opportunity,"" said Amit Solvi. ""And Israel has to take this opportunity in both hands. And evolve that into a diplomatic agreement."""
"590","International","Columbus was a Sephardic Jew from western Europe, study finds","https://www.samaa.tv/2087322419-columbus-was-a-sephardic-jew-from-western-europe-study-finds","The 15th-century explorer Christopher Columbus was a Sephardic Jew from Western Europe, Spanish scientists said, after using DNA analysis to tackle a centuries-old mystery. Several countries have argued over the origins and the final burial place of the divisive figure who led Spanish-funded expeditions from the 1490s onward, opening the way for the European conquest of the Americas. Many historians have questioned the traditional theory that Columbus came from Genoa, Italy. Other theories range from him being a Spanish Jew or a Greek, to Basque, Portuguese or British. To solve the mystery researchers conducted a 22-year investigation, led by forensic expert Miguel Lorente, by testing tiny samples of remains buried in Seville Cathedral, long marked by authorities there as the last resting place of Columbus, though there had been rival claims. They compared them with those of known relatives and descendants and their findings were announced in a documentary titled ""Columbus DNA: The true origin"" on Spain's national broadcaster TVE on Saturday. ""We have DNA from Christopher Columbus, very partial, but sufficient. We have DNA from Hernando Colón, his son,"" Lorente said in the programme. ""And both in the Y chromosome (male) and in the mitochondrial DNA (transmitted by the mother) of Hernando there are traits compatible with Jewish origin."" Around 300,000 Jews lived in Spain before the 'Reyes Catolicos', Catholic monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand, ordered Jews and Muslims to convert to the Catholic faith or leave the country. Many settled around the world. The word Sephardic comes from Sefarad, or Spain in Hebrew. After analysing 25 possible places, Lorente said it was only possible to say Columbus was born in Western Europe. On Thursday, Lorente said they had confirmed previous theories that the remains in Seville Cathedral belonged to Columbus. Research on Columbus' nationality was complicated by a number of factors including the large amount of data. But ""the outcome is almost absolutely reliable,"" Lorente said. Columbus died in Valladolid, Spain, in 1506, but wished to be buried on the island of Hispaniola that is today shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. His remains were taken there in 1542, then moved to Cuba in 1795 and then, it had been long thought in Spain, to Seville in 1898."

Torrential rain and strong winds hit the region, leaving at least one person dead in the French port city of Sète, where a storm surge overturned three boats. Authorities reported that an amateur sailor lost their life, while another remains in critical condition. The storm left 64,000 people without power in southern France, with multiple roads flooded and emergency services working to clear debris. The French government has placed 29 departments on orange alert and issued a red alert for the Seine-et-Marne region due to potential flooding along the swollen Grand Morin River. In a press briefing, Energy and Ecological Transition Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher warned that such severe weather events are becoming more frequent due to climate change, urging citizens to remain cautious. Portugal and Spain were also heavily affected. Portugal experienced 300,000 power outages and widespread damage, with the northern city of Porto seeing the worst of it. In Spain, the regions of Asturias and Galicia faced winds of up to 140 kilometers per hour, leading to blocked roads and mudslides. Authorities across Western Europe continue to monitor the situation as remnants of Hurricane Kirk bring further risks of flooding and storm damage."

He gave no details about the timing of the deportation or where Bin Laden had been sent. ""Mr Bin Laden, who has lived in the Orne region for several years as the spouse of a British national, posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that glorified terrorism,"" Retailleau said on X. ""The administrative ban ensures that Mr Bin Laden cannot return to France for any reason whatsoever."" Bin Laden could not immediately be reached for comment. According to local weekly newspaper Le Publicateur Libre, Bin Laden caught the attention of French authorities over a social media post on the birthday of his father, who was killed by US forces in 2011. Reuters was not immediately able to locate the social media post. The paper reported in July 2023 that police had searched for Bin Laden in the village of Domfort, Normandy."

President Joe Biden's administration has been engaged in urgent discussions with Congress to allow it to use up $5.6 billion in military aid for Ukraine before Sept 30 - the end of the federal fiscal year - when the authority was set to expire. On Thursday, US officials said, the White House intends to notify Congress it will move forward with the announcement of a $5.6 billion drawdown from US weapons stocks. The contents of that package are still in flux, the officials said. Reuters reported this month that the Biden administration was considering a backup plan under which it would announce plans for shipments for Ukraine, but with an extended delivery timeline for the weapons and equipment, allowing for a more gradual transfer of resources to Ukraine without missing the Sept 30 deadline. A second announcement slated for Thursday will be for $2.4 billion worth of aid under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative program, which allows the administration to buy weapons for Ukraine from companies rather than pull them from US stocks. That aid will include munitions, weapons to combat drones and material to support munitions production in Ukraine, one of the US officials said. In addition, the US announced on Wednesday $375 million worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine. The package will include the first shipment of a precision-guided glide bomb with a range of up to 81 miles (130 km) called the Joint Standoff Weapon, two US officials said. The inclusion of that weapon was not disclosed in the announcement. The package, includes patrol boats, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, spare parts and other weapons. The Joint Standoff Weapon would be dropped from fighter jets, and is capable of striking targets with high accuracy. Ukraine has been largely prohibited from using US-supplied weapons in strikes into Russia. Presidential Drawdown Authority allows the president to draw from current weapons stocks to help allies in an emergency. In August, as Ukraine was pressing an incursion into Russia and losing territory in its east to Russian advances, Washington announced two packages, both for $125 million each. Congress has approved nearly $175 billion of aid and military assistance for Ukraine and allied nations in the 2-1/2 years since Russia's full-scale invasion, and many lawmakers say they expect Washington will need to approve more money to help the government in Kyiv in the next several months. US companies that might benefit from increased weapons shipments to Ukraine include arms makers like RTX, Lockheed Martin General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. "

The first major task for Barnier, appointed just over two weeks ago, will be to submit a 2025 budget plan addressing France's financial situation, which the prime minister this week called ""very serious"". Conservative Barnier is best known internationally for leading the European Union's Brexit negotiations with the UK. The long political career of France's new prime minister, Michel Barnier More recently, he has had the difficult job of submitting a cabinet for Macron's approval that has the best chance of surviving a no-confidence motion in parliament. Tough talks on the distribution of the 39 cabinet posts continued right up to Saturday's official announcement, insiders said, with moments of high tension between the president and his prime minister. Opposition politicians from the left have already announced they will challenge his government with a confidence motion. In the July election, a left-wing bloc called the New Popular Front (NFP) won the most parliamentary seats of any political bloc, but not enough for an overall majority. Macron argued that the left would be unable to muster enough support to form a government that would not immediately be brought down in parliament. He turned instead to Barnier to lead a government drawing mostly on parliamentary support from Macron's allies, as well as from the conservative Republicans (LR) and the centrists groups. 'Government of the general election losers' Macron was counting too, on a neutral stance from the far right -- but the leader of the National Rally (RN) Jordan Bardella was quick to condemn the composition of the new government. It marked ""a return to Macronism"" and so had ""no future whatsoever"", he said Saturday. At the other end of the political spectrum, far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon called the new lineup ""a government of the general election losers"". France, he said, should ""get rid"" of the government ""as soon as possible"", while his party threatened to ""increase popular pressure"" on the government. Melenchon dismissed the new government as made up of 'general election losers' Melenchon dismissed the new government as made up of 'general election losers' © Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP/File Socialist party chairman Oliver Faure dismissed Barnier's cabinet as ""a reactionary government that gives democracy the finger"". Among the new faces in key cabinet posts are Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, a centrist, while conservative Bruno Retailleau takes over at the interior ministry. His portfolio covers immigration and his right-wing credentials have created unease even in Macron's own camp. Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu, a close Macron ally, has kept his job. The difficult job of submitting a budget plan to parliament next month falls to 33-year-old Antoine Armand, the new finance minister. He has previously served as head of parliament's economic affairs commission. The only left-of-centre politician is a little-known former Socialist Didier Migaud who was named justice minister. Street protests Even before the announcement, thousands of people with left-leaning sympathies took to the streets in Paris, the southern port city of Marseille and elsewhere on Saturday to protest. They were objecting to a cabinet they say does not reflect the outcome of the parliamentary election. The new government has nobody from inside the NFP bloc. Barnier is to address parliament with a key policy speech on October 1st. He then has the urgent task of submitting a budget plan to the National Assembly aimed at controlling France's rising budget deficit and debt mountain -- the first major test of his administration. France was placed on a formal procedure for violating European Union budgetary rules before Barnier was picked as head of government. France's public-sector deficit is projected to reach around 5.6 percent of GDP this year and go over six percent in 2025, which compares with EU rules calling for a three-percent ceiling on deficits. ""I am discovering that the country's budgetary situation is very serious,"" Barnier said in a statement to AFP on Wednesday, adding that the situation required ""more than just pretty statements"". The new cabinet's first meeting is scheduled for Monday afternoon."

Shakeri allegedly told law enforcement he had no plans to formulate a plan to kill Trump within the IRGC's timeline. The department described Shakeri, 51, as an IRGC asset residing in Tehran.

Some 2,400 firefighters were aided by more favorable winds coming from the Pacific Ocean after previously hot and dry winds coming from the desert fanned the so-called Mountain Fire, which broke out on Wednesday about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Los Angeles. The fire had consumed 20,630 acres (8,350 hectares) by Friday, virtually unchanged from 24 hours earlier, and was 14% contained, up from 7%, Cal Fire officials told a press conference. ""We had no external or lateral movement today. That is fantastic,"" Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner told a news briefing. Residents of 3,500 homes were able to return home but another 2,000 homes remained under evacuation orders, Ventura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff said. Fueled by dry brush and steep, rugged terrain, the fire remained a threat to critical infrastructure and islands would continue to burn within its footprint. Among those who lost a home was Dennis Gottlieb of Ventura County. He counted himself lucky to be alive as he waited early on Friday morning at a shelter at Padre Serra Parish Catholic Church in Camarillo, California. He said he lost all his possessions except his truck. ""It was windy, real windy, but that's all, so I just started my regular day until I saw the smoke and then the fire,"" he said. Gottlieb said he grabbed some garden hoses and thought he could keep the blaze away from the house. ""Suddenly the smoke got real heavy and embers were falling all around,"" he said. ""It was hot, real hot, like 150 degrees (65 C). So I grabbed the keys to my truck,"" he said. He and his wife, Linda Fellerman, barely made it out. One road was blocked by a fallen tree until a neighbor with a chainsaw cut it away. He went back on Thursday to see if he could salvage any keepsakes but said, ""Everything is gone. All gone. Burned up."" A red flag warning for the area was lifted as winds were expected to calm to less than 15 miles per hour (24 kph) and humidity was due to climb, the National Weather Service said. The dry Santa Ana winds that fanned the flames at first with gusts of 80 mph to 100 mph earlier this week are expected to stay calm over the weekend, topping out at 20-to-25 mph, said Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the NWS office in Oxnard, California. ""The rain chances are low to none,"" he said. ""But while the winds are calmer now, they're going to pick up again by Tuesday."" Officials braced people for a difficult recovery. ""The only thing left standing of our house is the two chimneys,"" Darren Kettle told the Los Angeles Times. ""My heart dropped to my stomach. It's just shocking, traumatic."" Climate scientists say warming temperatures have created wet winters that allowed California's coastal chaparral - areas dominated by small trees, shrubs and bushes - to thrive. Record-high temperatures this summer dried out hillsides, priming them for wildfire. The United States is experiencing a strong wildfire year with 8.1 million acres (3.3 million hectares) burned to date, compared with an annual, full-year average of around 7 million acres over the last decade, according to National Interagency Fire Center data. So far this year, California wildfires have burned more than three times as much land as last year at this time, according to Cal Fire data."

The 22-year-old left-hander scored a commanding 161 on the third day of the first match in the five-Test series, solidifying his reputation as one of India’s most promising talents. Jaiswal, who had started the day on 90, exhibited patience and precision to notch up his fourth century in just 15 Test matches. His impressive innings against a formidable Australian bowling attack adds to his growing list of achievements, which includes a debut century of 171 against the West Indies in 2023 and two double centuries against England earlier this year. Journey of resilience Hailing from a humble background, Jaiswal’s journey to stardom is a testament to his resilience and determination. Born in a small village, he moved to Mumbai at the age of 11 with dreams of donning the Indian jersey. Without stable accommodation, he initially stayed with his uncle before being asked to find another place due to space constraints. “I used to sleep in a dairy and later in a tent near Azad Maidan,” Jaiswal revealed in an interview in 2020. Azad Maidan, known as a cricketing hub in Mumbai, became his training ground where he honed his skills during the day. To sustain himself, Jaiswal sold street snacks, fetched balls during club matches, and even kept score for local games. His hard work bore fruit when he became the youngest batsman to score a domestic one-day double century at just 17 years and 292 days in 2019. IPL breakthrough Jaiswal’s breakthrough moment came in 2019 when he was picked by the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction. He shone in the 2023 season, forming a formidable opening pair with England’s Jos Buttler. His 625 runs at a strike rate exceeding 163 made him a standout performer. From enduring hardship on the streets of Mumbai to scoring runs against the world’s best bowlers, Jaiswal’s rise embodies the spirit of Indian cricket’s new generation. His latest heroics in Perth have further endeared him to fans, who see him as a future mainstay in the Indian lineup."

After setting a formidable target, India bowled out Australia for 238 in the final session, extending their dominance in Australian conditions. This victory underscores India's recent success down under, having won five of their last nine Tests in Australia since their triumphant 2018-19 tour. Resuming the day at a precarious 12-3, Australia’s batting lineup faltered against India's pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Early breakthroughs included Siraj dismissing Usman Khawaja for a mere five runs, and Steve Smith falling for 17 after being expertly set up by the Indian pacer. A glimmer of hope came through Travis Head (89) and Mitchell Marsh (47), who put up a spirited fightback. However, both were dismissed in quick succession, with Bumrah and debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy dismantling their partnership. India’s spinners also made valuable contributions, with Washington Sundar claiming two wickets, including Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon, before Nitish Rana’s slower ball deceived Alex Carey to seal the emphatic win. The result leaves Australia facing an uphill battle to reclaim dominance in the series, having not won a Test series against India since 2015. This defeat has raised questions about Australia’s batting lineup, particularly the form of key players. Top-order stalwarts Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, and Marnus Labuschagne are without centuries in their past 11, 11, and nine Tests, respectively. Debutant Nathan McSweeney managed just 10 runs across two innings, prompting scrutiny over his selection as an opener, despite lacking experience in the role at first-class level. Australia’s lack of aggression with the ball has also drawn criticism, with some pundits questioning their tactics in critical moments of the match. The second Test will take place in Adelaide on December 6, where Australia has won nine of their past ten matches. However, their sole loss in that run was against India, making the upcoming game a crucial one for Pat Cummins' side. With this victory, India edges closer to securing a spot in their third consecutive World Test Championship final. The visitors need three wins from the remaining four matches to guarantee their place, while Australia must win five Tests across this series and their upcoming tour of Sri Lanka to stay in contention."

According to reports from The Daily Mail, Akram, who is in Australia for Star Sports’ commentary duties, was leaving the venue and attempting to catch a cab when the fan approached him once again. In an unexpected turn of events, the fan hurled abusive remarks at the cricket icon. The exchange left Akram visibly upset, prompting immediate intervention from security personnel. The fan was swiftly escorted away from the scene, though the motive behind the harassment remains unclear. It has been confirmed that the abuse was not racially motivated, and there is no indication that the fan was intoxicated at the time. However, the incident has raised concerns over the safety of commentators, particularly in high-profile matches like the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. In response, Cricket Australia has assured Akram that enhanced security measures will be in place for the remainder of the Test match. These measures include increased security around commentators during live broadcasts, and commentators will now have the option of being escorted to the venue by cars directly to ensure their safety. Meanwhile, on the field, India has taken a commanding lead in the Test match, with the visitors controlling proceedings after dismissing Australia for just 104 runs in their first innings. ~Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional five-wicket haul left Australia reeling, and India's openers, KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal, extended their advantage with a commanding partnership of 201 runs. Rahul, who fell for 77, was overshadowed by Jaiswal, who smashed 161 runs, marking his first Test century in Australian conditions. With India declaring their second innings at 487-6, the hosts face an uphill battle, needing 534 runs to win, with just a short time left to survive before stumps."

A total of 84 players went under the hammer, but it was Indian talent that stole the spotlight, with three players securing deals worth over Rs 20 crore. Leading the charge was Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, who made history by becoming the most expensive player in IPL history. The 27-year-old left-handed batter was acquired by Lucknow Super Giants for a staggering Rs 27 crore, surpassing the previous record set by Shreyas Iyer just moments earlier. Iyer, the former Delhi Capitals star, fetched Rs 26.75 crore, joining Pant in the list of the two highest-paid players in IPL history. Pant and Iyer were part of the marquee Set 1 players, and despite Iyer being picked first, Pant’s record-breaking deal underscored the immense demand for top-tier Indian talent in the league.Adding to the excitement, Madhya Pradesh all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer also secured a massive deal, rejoining Kolkata Knight Riders for Rs 23.75 crore after a fierce bidding battle with Royal Challengers Bangalore. Punjab Kings, which entered the auction with a purse of Rs 110.50 crore, made their mark by signing Indian left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh and veteran spinner Yuzvendra Chahal for Rs 18 crore each. This ensured that all of the top five picks on Day 1 were Indian players, a trend that surprised some fans but was in line with past mega auction patterns. Historically, Indian players have dominated IPL mega auctions. In the 2022 auction, for example, the top three highest-paid players were all Indian, with Ishan Kishan securing Rs 15.25 crore and Deepak Chahar fetching Rs 14 crore. The same trend was observed in the 2018 auction, when Indian players filled the top spots alongside England’s Ben Stokes, highlighting the league’s preference for homegrown talent in its rebuilding phases. Overseas players, while securing significant paydays in mini auctions, have not been able to match the bidding frenzy that Indian players generate during mega auctions. The reason lies in the sheer number of quality Indian players available, whereas overseas stars tend to make themselves available for only short stints, limiting the pool of competition."

The former UFC champion was ordered to pay over £200,000 in damages to Nikita Hand after a Dublin jury found him liable for assault in a 2018 incident at a hotel. McGregor, who denies the allegations, has maintained that the encounter was consensual and intends to appeal the verdict. The legal decision quickly drew reactions from McGregor’s critics, most notably Jake Paul, who used Twitter to target McGregor, saying, “Dana hits his wife, Conor’s convicted of rape, but I’m the bad guy.” The tweet, which referenced McGregor’s recent legal issues and those of UFC President Dana White, triggered a strong response from the Irish fighter. McGregor, using his Twitter handle, TheNotoriousMMA, retorted with a homophobic slur, referring to Paul as a “little gay nerd.” The comment, widely condemned on social media, led to immediate backlash, with many pointing out the inappropriate nature of McGregor's response. Paul, in turn, criticized McGregor for his offensive remark, accusing him of reflecting poorly on his character. The case, which has drawn significant public attention, involved Nikita Hand’s accusations of assault by McGregor at a Dublin hotel. Addressing the media outside court, Hand expressed hope that her case would encourage other survivors to come forward. “No matter how afraid you might be, speak up, you have a voice,” Hand said, expressing gratitude for the support of her family and friends. The jury deliberated for over six hours before reaching a verdict, finding McGregor liable for assault. However, Hand's case against another man, James Lawrence, whom she accused of non-consensual sex during the same incident, was dismissed. After the court proceedings, McGregor, who had remained silent as he left the courtroom, issued a statement later, saying, “I will be appealing today’s decision. I am with my family now, focused on my future.” "

After a day dominated by bowlers, where 17 wickets fell, openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal turned the tide with a resolute unbeaten stand of 84, showcasing patience and skill on a challenging pitch. KL Rahul was steady with 34* at the break, while Jaiswal added flair to the innings, reaching 37*, including a remarkable six off Mitchell Starc. The duo effectively nullified Australia’s bowlers, who seemed frustrated and tired after being forced back onto the field shortly after bundling India out for 150 on day one. Earlier in the day, India's bowlers wrapped up Australia’s first innings for 104, securing a 46-run lead. Mohammad Rana claimed the last wicket, dismissing Mitchell Starc for 26, and finished with figures of 3 for 48. Australia’s last-wicket pair added a vital 66 runs, with Josh Hazlewood and Starc frustrating the Indian attack. Despite the recovery, Australia’s batting woes were highlighted by their failure to capitalize on a lively surface. With no batter crossing the 30-run mark, the home side’s top order remains under scrutiny. The pitch, which saw exaggerated seam movement on day one, seemed to ease slightly, giving India an opportunity to counterattack. Jaiswal and Rahul capitalized on this, with India’s strategy of absorbing pressure and rotating strike paying off. As the match progresses, Australia will need early breakthroughs to stay in the game, while India look set to consolidate their lead and push for a commanding position.

The accuser, Nikita Hand, testified that she had been assaulted by McGregor during a night of partying that turned traumatic. The 2018 events unfolded when McGregor, then 30, was at the pinnacle of his career, celebrated globally for his success in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and a high-profile boxing match against Floyd Mayweather Jr. The court heard that Ms Hand and McGregor had exchanged messages on Instagram in the months leading up to the encounter. On December 16, 2018, Ms Hand, then 29, was attending a Christmas party with colleagues at a salon where she worked in Dublin.After a long night of drinking and taking cocaine, she messaged McGregor early the next morning, seeking his phone number. McGregor, who had spent the evening at nightclubs in Dublin, arranged to meet Ms. Hand and her colleague Danielle Kealey. They gathered in McGregor’s car and drove around before heading to a penthouse suite at the Beacon Hotel, which he had booked earlier that night. Conflicting testimonies The accounts of what transpired at the hotel diverged starkly in court. McGregor testified that the sexual encounter was consensual, describing it as “enthusiastic” and initiated by Ms. Hand. However, Ms. Hand gave a harrowing account of being pinned down and assaulted, despite her attempts to resist. ""He just wouldn't take no for an answer,"" Ms. Hand told the court. ""I remember he pinned me to the bed. I couldn’t move or breathe."" She alleged that McGregor used his strength to overpower her and ignored her protests. CCTV footage from the hotel showed Ms. Hand visibly intoxicated in the elevator shortly before and after the alleged assault. She described herself as “a vulnerable, drunk woman who did not know what she was doing.” Following the incident, Ms. Hand confided in her salon manager and later disclosed the details to her boyfriend. A recording of her emotional account to her partner was played in court, where she expressed fear of retaliation if she named her attacker. McGregor denied all allegations, claiming that the encounter was consensual and that Ms. Hand showed no signs of distress. His defense described the allegations as an attempt to tarnish his reputation. The case has drawn widespread attention, not only due to McGregor’s celebrity status but also because of its implications for issues of consent, substance use, and power dynamics. The jury’s decision has reignited conversations about accountability in the world of sports and entertainment, where public figures are often held to a different standard. McGregor’s representatives have yet to comment on the verdict, while Ms. Hand’s legal team has expressed relief that justice has been served."

The home team reached the close trailing by 83 runs as India's pacemen also feasted on a 17-wicket day. It was stand-in captain Bumrah who rose to the occasion, leading his team back from the brink by exploiting the seam-friendly conditions to register 4-17 in the final session and leaving Australia rattled. ""The wicket is helping a lot,"" debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy said. ""We don't need to do much to get the wickets. Keep disciplined and eventually wickets came our way."" Bumrah earlier won the toss and boldly elected to bat.  In an inexperienced lineup missing skipper Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, it was left to Rishabh Pant (37) and Reddy (41) to breathe life into India's first innings after a slew of early wickets. The morning started ominously when Yashasvi Jaiswal and Devdutt Padikkal departed for ducks and Josh Hazlewood (4-29) had Virat Kohli, in the midst of a century-drought lasting 16 months, caught in the slips for five. Things went from bad to worse when an irritated KL Rahul (26) trudged off after the third umpire judged that he edged Mitchell Starc (2-14) to keeper Alex Carey as bat brushed pad. A scarcely believable six over fine leg by Pant, scooped from a Pat Cummins delivery outside off-stump, highlighted the Pant-Reddy resistance of 48 runs. Australia's impressive fielding display culminated when Nathan McSweeney and Marnus Labuschagne combined for a rare team-catch, bobbled from one to the other in the slips to leave Harshit Rana (seven) stunned, and the bowler Hazlewood jubilant. Tea was taken when Cummins (2-67) had Reddy caught by Usman Khawaja, wrapping up the innings. In the third session, Australia's newly-capped opener McSweeney got off the mark with a deft glance to the fine leg boundary but he departed for 10 when Bumrah had him pinned leg-before. The 30-year-old rounded out a spectacular opening spell by inducing an edge from Khawaja (eight) and then trapping Steve Smith in front for a golden duck on the next ball. Travis Head added 11 before becoming Rana's first test wicket, beaten for pace, and Australia were reeling at 47-6 when Labuschagne was given out lbw to give Mohammed Siraj his second scalp. Bumrah brought himself back on prior to the close, and celebrated his fourth wicket when keeper Pant gobbled up a thick Cummins edge. Carey (19) and Starc (six) remain not out overnight and will be key to steering Australia past their lowest score of 83 against India. ""If you can get through the testing period, it does get easier,"" Starc said. "

The match was filled with tension and excitement, culminating in a decisive doubles rubber victory by Matthew Ebden and Jordan Thompson, who defeated Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul 6-4, 6-4. The tie began with Australia taking the lead as Thanasi Kokkinakis edged past Shelton 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (16/14) in a nail-biting tie-break that ended in one of the longest in Davis Cup history. Kokkinakis saved four match points and overcame six of his own before securing victory in the gripping finale. The United States leveled the tie when world number four Taylor Fritz easily dispatched Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-4 in the second singles match. Fritz, fresh off a successful season, including a runner-up finish at the ATP Finals, proved too strong for the Australian, wrapping up the match in just 71 minutes. With the tie at 1-1, the focus shifted to the doubles rubber. Ebden, a veteran with gold medal experience at the Paris Olympics and a recent Australian Open doubles triumph, joined forces with Thompson to win an intense contest. The Australian duo broke for a 2-1 lead in the second set, and despite a strong fight from the Americans, they served out the match to clinch victory. Australia’s captain, Lleyton Hewitt, expressed his pride in the team’s performance. ""I'm super proud of the boys and the effort they put in,"" Hewitt said. The victory secured Australia’s spot in the semi-finals, where they will face either Italy or Argentina, who play later on Thursday. The US, who have a long history in the Davis Cup, were aiming for their first title since 2007, with Fritz leading their charge. However, Australia’s resilience in the doubles rubber proved the difference, sending them to their first semi-final since 2019. In the other half of the draw, the Netherlands will take on Germany in the first semi-final on Friday, following their victory over Spain earlier in the week. Australia, with 28 Davis Cup titles to their name, will now look to continue their pursuit of a 29th crown."

The 22-year-old left-hander scored a commanding 161 on the third day of the first match in the five-Test series, solidifying his reputation as one of India’s most promising talents. Jaiswal, who had started the day on 90, exhibited patience and precision to notch up his fourth century in just 15 Test matches. His impressive innings against a formidable Australian bowling attack adds to his growing list of achievements, which includes a debut century of 171 against the West Indies in 2023 and two double centuries against England earlier this year. Journey of resilience Hailing from a humble background, Jaiswal’s journey to stardom is a testament to his resilience and determination. Born in a small village, he moved to Mumbai at the age of 11 with dreams of donning the Indian jersey. Without stable accommodation, he initially stayed with his uncle before being asked to find another place due to space constraints. “I used to sleep in a dairy and later in a tent near Azad Maidan,” Jaiswal revealed in an interview in 2020. Azad Maidan, known as a cricketing hub in Mumbai, became his training ground where he honed his skills during the day. To sustain himself, Jaiswal sold street snacks, fetched balls during club matches, and even kept score for local games. His hard work bore fruit when he became the youngest batsman to score a domestic one-day double century at just 17 years and 292 days in 2019. IPL breakthrough Jaiswal’s breakthrough moment came in 2019 when he was picked by the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction. He shone in the 2023 season, forming a formidable opening pair with England’s Jos Buttler. His 625 runs at a strike rate exceeding 163 made him a standout performer. From enduring hardship on the streets of Mumbai to scoring runs against the world’s best bowlers, Jaiswal’s rise embodies the spirit of Indian cricket’s new generation. His latest heroics in Perth have further endeared him to fans, who see him as a future mainstay in the Indian lineup."

According to reports from The Daily Mail, Akram, who is in Australia for Star Sports’ commentary duties, was leaving the venue and attempting to catch a cab when the fan approached him once again. In an unexpected turn of events, the fan hurled abusive remarks at the cricket icon. The exchange left Akram visibly upset, prompting immediate intervention from security personnel. The fan was swiftly escorted away from the scene, though the motive behind the harassment remains unclear. It has been confirmed that the abuse was not racially motivated, and there is no indication that the fan was intoxicated at the time. However, the incident has raised concerns over the safety of commentators, particularly in high-profile matches like the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. In response, Cricket Australia has assured Akram that enhanced security measures will be in place for the remainder of the Test match. These measures include increased security around commentators during live broadcasts, and commentators will now have the option of being escorted to the venue by cars directly to ensure their safety. Meanwhile, on the field, India has taken a commanding lead in the Test match, with the visitors controlling proceedings after dismissing Australia for just 104 runs in their first innings. ~Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional five-wicket haul left Australia reeling, and India's openers, KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal, extended their advantage with a commanding partnership of 201 runs. Rahul, who fell for 77, was overshadowed by Jaiswal, who smashed 161 runs, marking his first Test century in Australian conditions. With India declaring their second innings at 487-6, the hosts face an uphill battle, needing 534 runs to win, with just a short time left to survive before stumps."

A total of 84 players went under the hammer, but it was Indian talent that stole the spotlight, with three players securing deals worth over Rs 20 crore. Leading the charge was Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, who made history by becoming the most expensive player in IPL history. The 27-year-old left-handed batter was acquired by Lucknow Super Giants for a staggering Rs 27 crore, surpassing the previous record set by Shreyas Iyer just moments earlier. Iyer, the former Delhi Capitals star, fetched Rs 26.75 crore, joining Pant in the list of the two highest-paid players in IPL history. Pant and Iyer were part of the marquee Set 1 players, and despite Iyer being picked first, Pant’s record-breaking deal underscored the immense demand for top-tier Indian talent in the league.Adding to the excitement, Madhya Pradesh all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer also secured a massive deal, rejoining Kolkata Knight Riders for Rs 23.75 crore after a fierce bidding battle with Royal Challengers Bangalore. Punjab Kings, which entered the auction with a purse of Rs 110.50 crore, made their mark by signing Indian left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh and veteran spinner Yuzvendra Chahal for Rs 18 crore each. This ensured that all of the top five picks on Day 1 were Indian players, a trend that surprised some fans but was in line with past mega auction patterns. Historically, Indian players have dominated IPL mega auctions. In the 2022 auction, for example, the top three highest-paid players were all Indian, with Ishan Kishan securing Rs 15.25 crore and Deepak Chahar fetching Rs 14 crore. The same trend was observed in the 2018 auction, when Indian players filled the top spots alongside England’s Ben Stokes, highlighting the league’s preference for homegrown talent in its rebuilding phases. Overseas players, while securing significant paydays in mini auctions, have not been able to match the bidding frenzy that Indian players generate during mega auctions. The reason lies in the sheer number of quality Indian players available, whereas overseas stars tend to make themselves available for only short stints, limiting the pool of competition."

The milestone knock came on the third day of play as Kohli battled mounting pressure after a string of low scores in recent matches. Walking in with India in a strong position, he delivered a flawless, unbeaten 100 off 143 balls, decorated with eight boundaries and two sixes. Kohli's record-breaking innings propelled India to a commanding lead of 533 runs. Subsequently, Indian captain Jasprit Bumrah decided to declare the innings. The century also marked Kohli's seventh in Test cricket on Australian soil, breaking Sachin Tendulkar’s record for the most centuries in Australia by an Indian player. Across all formats, Kohli has now notched 10 centuries in Australia, overtaking Englishman Jack Hobbs, who had previously held the record with nine.

The 22-year-old Spain international, who has struggled with injuries in recent seasons, will miss several key matches, including Barcelona’s upcoming Champions League clash with Brest on November 26 and several La Liga fixtures. The Catalan club announced that Fati had suffered a muscle injury to his right hamstring, and although specific details were not provided, the expected recovery time is around four weeks. This means the young forward will miss La Liga encounters against Celta Vigo, Las Palmas, Mallorca, and Real Betis. Fati's injury is part of a growing list of injury concerns at Barcelona, as the club also faces setbacks with other key players. Lamine Yamal, who recently broke Fati’s record as the youngest-ever Barcelona player and goalscorer, is sidelined for around three weeks due to an ankle issue.

Meanwhile, Ipswich Town stunned Tottenham 2-1 for their first Premier League win in over two decades. In a match that marked Bruno Fernandes' 250th appearance for Manchester United, the Portuguese midfielder played a pivotal role, scoring his fourth goal in as many games. Fernandes’ neat link-up with Amad Diallo set up the first goal before his burst into the box deflected a shot off Leicester defender Victor Kristiansen for an own goal, doubling United’s lead. Diallo, who scored twice in a 2-0 Europa League win earlier in the week, added a third with a stunning strike from Alejandro Garnacho's assist to complete the 3-0 victory. United, who remain in 13th place, now sit just three points shy of fifth place in a congested Premier League table. Van Nistelrooy, who stepped in after Erik ten Hag's sacking, handed over the reins to Ruben Amorim, who will take charge following the international break. Ipswich Town claimed their first Premier League win in 22 years, defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Sammie Szmodics opened the scoring with a remarkable overhead kick, followed by a close-range finish from Liam Delap. Although Rodrigo Bentancur pulled one back for Spurs, Ipswich held firm to secure all three points. The victory saw them climb out of the relegation zone, moving ahead of Crystal Palace, while Spurs slipped to 10th place after their fifth defeat in 11 games. Nottingham Forest’s impressive run of three consecutive wins came to a halt at home, with Newcastle United emerging 3-1 victors. Forest took the lead with a towering header from Murillo, but the Magpies responded in the second half. Alexander Isak's header began the fightback, followed by a brilliant strike from Joelinton, and a third goal from Harvey Barnes sealed the win. The result lifted Newcastle to eighth in the table while Forest remained in third, just behind Liverpool and Manchester City. Arsenal, currently 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, face a crucial away fixture against Chelsea, hoping to snap a three-game winless streak in the Premier League. Captain Martin Ødegaard, making his first appearance in two months, will be key to Arsenal's hopes of a revival.

Arne Slot's side made it nine wins from their opening 11 league games with a Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah scoring the goals in a deadly demonstration of counter-attacking. City took the lead with Erling Haaland scoring his 12th league goal of the campaign but late goals by Joao Pedro and Matt O'Riley stunned Pep Guardiola's side who enter the international break with much to ponder. Liverpool head into the international break with 28 points from 11 games with City on 23 while Brighton and Hove Albion are in fourth place on 19 points. Third-placed Nottingham Forest could move to 22 points if they beat Newcastle United on Sunday. Dutchman Slot has enjoyed a remarkable start at Liverpool with 15 wins from his first 17 in charge since replacing the seemingly irreplaceable Juergen Klopp. His style is more pragmatic than Klopp's but no less spectacular at times, as they showed on Saturday. Nunez opened the scoring after 20 minutes when Liverpool broke at lightning pace following an Aston Villa corner and after Mohamed Salah was bundled over by Leon Bailey, Nunez took matters into his own hands to round Emiliano Martinez and blast home a shot from a narrow angle. Villa, whose season has hit a rough patch, were denied an equaliser by some excellent saves by Caoimhin Kelleher but were floored late on when after another counter-attack from deep in Liverpool's half, Salah burst clear to finish in style. ""In general we had control over the game and scored from two counter-attacks which is maybe not what we would expect,"" Slot said. ""Margins are small, we have a margin but it is small. ""There are many challenges to come for us."" Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva said after the 4-1 thrashing away to Sporting in the Champions League in midweek that the team were in a dark place. And despite Haaland's early goal at Brighton, the gloom deepened as they lost their grip on the game with Joao Pedro and O'Riley capping memorable night for the Seagulls. ""I will reflect in these ten days. Clear our heads, players come back fit, this is the target,"" Guardiola, whose only similar run in all competitions was at Bayern Munich in 2015 when he suffered three back-to-back defeats and a penalty shoot-out loss in the German Cup, told reporters. ""We try to analyse how we perform - four in a row. Okay. The question is how we are playing. The level we're playing is really good in certain moments but we are not able to continue."" It is also the first time City have lost four successive games in all competitions in 18 years. Fulham climbed to seventh after a 2-0 win away at London rivals Crystal Palace with goals by Emile Smith Rowe and Harry Wilson. The hosts were reduced to 10 men after Daichi Kamada was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle. Brentford twice came from behind to beat Bournemouth 3-2 thanks to a brace from Yoane Wissa. Wolverhampton Wanderers finally tasted victory after a wretched start to the season as they beat fellow strugglers Southampton 2-0 to climb off the foot of the table. Pablo Sarabia scored after two minutes -- Wolves' fastest goal in a Premier League match -- and Matheus Cunha wrapped up the points to the relief of manager Gary O'Neil. Wolves moved up to 18th place with six points with Southampton now bottom on four. Ipswich Town, now the only team in the Premier League without a win, have five points ahead of their visit to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. West Ham United and Everton played out a dull 0-0 draw at the London Stadium."

Despite this, Van Nistelrooy remains hopeful that young talents Rasmus Højlund and Joshua Zirkzee can eventually fill that crucial role. United have scored just nine goals in their first 10 Premier League matches of the 2024/25 season, with only Southampton and Crystal Palace registering fewer. This lack of cutting edge in front of goal was a key issue that contributed to Erik ten Hag's departure as manager last month. Van Nistelrooy, who was known for his clinical finishing during his playing days at Old Trafford, is fully aware that the club must improve its goal-scoring record to compete at the highest level. However, he is optimistic about the potential of Højlund, who has scored twice in 11 appearances so far this season despite an injury-riddled start, and Zirkzee, who has netted just once in 16 games since his move from Bologna. ""We need a certain amount of goals to be successful in the Premier League and in Europe,"" Van Nistelrooy said. ""The best teams in the world have those players, but we have young players who are still developing. The belief is there that they can reach that level."" Manchester United invested over £100 million ($129 million) to sign Højlund and Zirkzee during the past two summer transfer windows, yet the duo has yet to consistently deliver the firepower needed to propel the team forward. In his short tenure as caretaker manager, Van Nistelrooy has led United to victories over Leicester in the League Cup and PAOK in the Europa League. He also held Chelsea to a 1-1 draw in his only Premier League match in charge to date. Van Nistelrooy's time in charge is expected to come to an end soon, as Ruben Amorim is set to take over from Sporting Lisbon next week. Despite his impending departure, the former United striker has expressed a desire to stay on as an assistant manager under Amorim. ""I knew when I came here it was a special occasion, and I want to be part of this journey with the club in an assistant role,"" Van Nistelrooy said. ""I still have ambitions to manage, but I’m happy to continue in my assistant capacity if that’s the direction the club takes."" With a key managerial change imminent, United will look to continue their recovery under Van Nistelrooy's guidance in their next match against Leicester on Sunday, before Amorim takes charge."

Despite stepping into the large shoes of former manager Jurgen Klopp, Slot has guided the team to an impressive record of 14 wins and one draw from their opening 16 matches across all competitions. As defending Premier League and Champions League title holders, Slot's transition to the helm has been seamless, thanks in part to the solid foundations laid by Klopp. Liverpool’s run has also seen them progress to the quarter-finals of the League Cup, further boosting their confidence and momentum. ""I wouldn’t say I’m shocked,"" Slot commented ahead of Liverpool's upcoming match against Aston Villa. ""I knew the quality of this team, but consistency is key. From the moment I started working with them, I saw the energy they put in every day, and that is why we’ve been able to maintain such a high level."" Liverpool's recent performances have been nothing short of spectacular. Anfield's electrifying atmosphere helped propel the Reds to a thrilling 2-1 comeback victory against Brighton last weekend, putting them two points ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. The momentum carried over into midweek, with Slot's side dismantling Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in the Champions League, further boosting their claim as one of Europe's top teams. Slot, however, remains focused on keeping his players grounded. While he is encouraged by the fans' enthusiasm, he emphasized the importance of staying consistent. ""If the excitement from the fans helps create the atmosphere we had in the second half against Brighton or in the game against Leverkusen, then I hope they stay excited,"" he added. Liverpool will be without Diogo Jota for their upcoming fixture, with the forward expected to return after the international break later this month. As the Reds look to extend their lead at the top of both competitions, Slot will continue to rely on the dedication and energy of his squad as they aim for just their second Premier League title in 35 years."

Sinner, runner-up to Novak Djokovic in the prestigious year-ending tournament last year, dropped behind early in the first set but quickly hit back to dominate the contest. The Italian, who won this year's Australian and U.S. Open titles to open his Grand Slam account, completed victory with an ace to make it eight wins out of eight against De Minaur. Earlier in the Ilie Nastase Group American Taylor Fritz beat Russian Daniil Medvedev 6-4 6-3. Sinner, 23, had not played a competitive match for four weeks since taking the title in Shanghai, his seventh of the season, and there was some early rust as he dropped serve to trail 2-1 in the opening set. But he broke back immediately and his power from the baseline proved too much for De Minaur thereafter as he was roared on by the crowd in the 13,000-seater Inalpi Arena. ""Considering I hadn't played for four weeks I'm very happy,"" Sinner said at court side. ""I started off with some unforced errors at the beginning of the match but I stayed there mentally knowing that at some point my tennis would arrive. ""It arrived quite early and started to return very well. Today I'm pleased with the win and it will give me confidence."" Sinner is hoping to cap a superb year on the court, although a cloud still hangs over the Italian who was cleared of wrongdoing by an independent tribunal after testing positive for the anabolic agent clostebol in March this year. The tribunal, organised by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), accepted Sinner's explanation that the banned substance entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has since appealed the 'no fault or negligence' decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Earlier in the day former ATP Finals champion Medvedev lost his cool and risked getting defaulted because of his bizarre antics during his defeat by Fritz . The 2020 champion lost his composure after a string of double faults in the first set as Fritz beat the Russian for the first time in his career. Medvedev served three double faults to drop serve at 4-5 in the first set and was so incensed that he smashed his racket. He lost his cool again in the second set and began to unravel, breaking a microphone with his racket while he was also given a point penalty. Bizarrely he later faced a Fritz serve holding the racket the wrong way round. ""I get angry, frustrated. This time completely with myself, not with anyone.

He had previously withdrawn from the Paris Masters earlier this month, signaling an end to a challenging season. 2024 marks the first year since 2006 that Djokovic has failed to secure an ATP title, with the younger generation, including players like Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, having eclipsed his position at the top of the sport. Despite these setbacks, Djokovic’s year was not without triumph, as he won singles gold at the Paris Olympics, completing his collection of major honors. Djokovic’s withdrawal from the ATP Finals also automatically opens up three places for other players, including Casper Ruud, Alex de Minaur, and Andrey Rublev, who were previously on the cusp of qualification. Ruud and Rublev are currently in action in Metz, while de Minaur is competing in Belgrade. With this announcement, Djokovic’s 2024 season officially came to a close, as he looks to recover from injury and regroup for a fresh start in 2025."

The 37-year-old Serbian, who holds a record 24 Grand Slam titles, fell to Sinner with a score of 7-6 (7/4), 6-3, marking his third defeat in four encounters against the 2023 Australian Open and US Open champion. Despite acknowledging that this has been ""one of the worst-performing seasons"" in terms of results, Djokovic remains resolute about his future in the sport. ""I don't know what the future brings; I'll just try to go with the flow,"" he stated during a press conference. He emphasized that he has no plans to follow his longtime rival Rafael Nadal into retirement. In 2024, Djokovic was unable to extend his Grand Slam tally, with Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz claiming the sport's major titles, including the French Open and Wimbledon. However, he did achieve a significant milestone by winning the Olympic gold medal in an emotionally charged final against Alcaraz in Paris, bringing his career title count to 99. Sunday's loss leaves Djokovic just one title shy of joining tennis legends Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer as the only players to reach 100 career titles. Yet, Djokovic downplayed the significance of this target, stating, ""It's not a live-or-die type of goal for me. I think I've achieved all of my biggest goals in my career."" He also praised Sinner, highlighting the young Italian's strong baseline play and tactical acumen. ""He's very solid from the forehand and backhand, doesn't make too many mistakes,"" Djokovic noted, reflecting on Sinner's ability to disrupt opponents' rhythm—a quality Djokovic himself has embodied throughout his illustrious career. As the tennis world watches closely, Djokovic's commitment to returning to the court next season leaves fans eager to see how he will redefine his legacy in the coming year."

However, upon his return to Pakistan, no arrangements were made, and the sources said that the PHF informed the player that there were no funds available for his treatment. The federation advised him to start his surgery and rehabilitation on his own, promising that the funds would be reimbursed when available, they added. The cost of Abubakar's knee surgery is reportedly in hundreds of thousands, and the player is uncertain about whether he will receive a refund. The sources said that the situation is further complicated by the risk that delaying surgery could worsen his injury. Initially, both the government and the PHF had suggested that Abubakar undergo surgery abroad, but this plan was abandoned due to the lack of funds.

The bout between the 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prizefighter Paul and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Tyson was streamed live on Netflix and played out in front of a sold-out crowd at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Those fans were left largely disappointed as Tyson showed his age and was never able to generate any offence against his younger opponent, landing just 18 punches to Paul's 78. ""First and foremost, Mike Tyson - it's an honour to be able to fight him,"" said Paul. ""It was as tough and hard as I thought it would be."" Tyson, who wore a knee brace, never mounted much of a challenge after being wobbled by some left hands in the third round but did enough defensively to avoid taking any serious damage. He admitted after the contest to fighting through a leg injury. ""Yeah, but I can't use that as an excuse. If I did, I wouldn't be in here,"" Tyson said. ""I knew he was a good fighter. He was prepared, I came to fight. I didn't prove nothing to anybody, only to myself. I'm not one of those guys that live to please the world. I'm just happy with what I can do.""

Despite a challenging run in recent home Tests, Bumrah backed the veteran batter to make a significant impact in Australia, where he has a strong history. Kohli, 36, has struggled in recent outings, managing just 93 runs in three Tests against New Zealand, averaging a mere 15.50. His poor form has been a talking point, especially after a lackluster home season against Bangladesh and New Zealand. However, Bumrah remained positive about Kohli’s preparation and mentality as India gears up for a tough series in Australian conditions. In a press conference ahead of the opening Test in Perth, Bumrah was asked about Kohli’s recent struggles and his readiness to face Australia's formidable bowling attack. Without hesitation, the Indian pacer stood by his senior teammate, emphasizing that one or two bad series do not define a player of Kohli’s caliber. ""I don't have to say anything about Virat Kohli, the batter. He is one of the greats of the game. I don't need to give him any special input. He is the utmost professional. He is one of the leaders. I made my debut under him. He knows what he is doing. One or two series, here and there, can go up and down,"" Bumrah stated, showing his belief in Kohli’s skills and experience. Bumrah went on to highlight Kohli’s current confidence, stressing that the batter is fully prepared and eager to contribute to the team’s success. While the bowler refrained from making predictions, he hinted at a positive outlook after seeing Kohli’s performance in the nets. ""The confidence he has at this moment, I have no doubts about how he has prepared. He is looking to contribute. The signs are ominous, I don’t want to jinx it, but he is looking in very good shape,"" Bumrah added. Kohli’s history in Australia provides further optimism. With 1,352 runs from 13 Tests at an average of 54.08, including six centuries, the Indian batter has proven himself in the bouncy conditions of the Australian pitches. This strong record offers Kohli a solid foundation as he aims to return to form in what promises to be a crucial series. As for the leadership of the Indian team, Bumrah will be leading the side in the absence of regular captain Rohit Sharma, who is staying back in India for the birth of his second child.

Although Babar scored 140 runs in the series, including a gritty 75 in Brisbane, his competitors managed to outperform him in crucial moments. Similarly, Mohammad Rizwan, Pakistan's reliable opener, slipped from 5th to 6th in the rankings. Rizwan had a challenging series, scoring 86 runs in three matches, falling short of his usual high standards. Bowling stars shine: Haris Rauf and Shaheen Afridi make gains Pakistan's pace sensation Haris Rauf made a significant jump in the T20I bowling rankings, moving from 24th to 20th place. Rauf's fiery spells were instrumental in Pakistan's victories, as he consistently troubled the Australian batters with his sheer pace and accuracy, claiming 7 wickets in the series. Shaheen Afridi, returning from injury, showcased his class and made a remarkable leap, climbing 10 spots to claim the 24th position in the bowling rankings. Shaheen’s match-winning 4-wicket haul in Sydney reminded fans and critics alike why he is considered one of the finest bowlers in the format. Pakistan’s search for a dependable T20I all-rounder continues, but young players like Aamer Jamal have shown promise. Although he hasn't broken into the top 20 rankings yet, his performances against Australia are indicative of his potential to rise in the coming months. The rankings update also highlighted stellar performances from players around the world. Australia's Adam Zampa climbed to 3rd in the bowling rankings, while Nathan Ellis rose to 11th, thanks to their dominant displays against Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's Tilak Varma made headlines by leaping an incredible 69 places to secure the 3rd spot in the batting rankings. His back-to-back centuries against South Africa were the highlight of the recent T20I fixtures. The upcoming T20I series against New Zealand offers an opportunity for Pakistani stars to regain lost ground in the rankings. With a fresh batch of players knocking on the door, the team's management will be keen to balance experience with youth to deliver strong performances on the international stage."

Speaking to the media in Lahore, Aqib highlighted that the new selection committee has significantly improved Pakistan's cricketing results. He also mentioned that Australia's conditions are not easy. “The results have improved a lot with the arrival of the new selection committee. Winning a series in Australia after 22 years was a major achievement, especially given the tough conditions there. The host team was also finding it difficult,” he said. Aqib also noted that playing according to conditions is crucial. Aqib Javed said the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had given him additional responsibilities, which he would try to fulfil to the fullest. ""I have been coaching for over 22 years and will use my experience with the team."" On Fakhar Zaman, Aqib acknowledged his talent and contributions to Pakistan’s successes. “Fakhar is a match-winning player. He had fitness issues, but if he improves, the selection committee will definitely reconsider him,” he assured. He also explained that the selection committee did not choose the team without the consent of the captain and coach, adding that efforts would be made to select the best available players. Aqib also shared insights into Pakistan's strategic focus. “There’s still over a year left for the next T20 World Cup, so a lot of changes will be seen. New players should be given opportunities, just as we have in the team for Zimbabwe. We’ll focus on ODI matches in upcoming series like Zimbabwe.” Highlighting the importance of understanding match conditions, Aqib said aggressive cricket is essential in T20s, but players must also adapt to varying situations. “In Asia, target rates rise during games, while even Australian players struggle to score 200 runs on their home grounds,” he observed. Aqib expressed confidence in emerging talent like Saim Ayub, whose career he believes is progressing well. He stressed the importance of giving new players chances and prioritising responsibility over strike rates, aiming to develop a balanced team."
"660","Sports","No fairytale ending as Nadal's career ends in defeat","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324264-no-fairytale-ending-as-nadal-s-career-ends-in-defeat","Rafael Nadal could not conjure the fairytale ending his career deserved as the Spanish 22-times Grand Slam champion bowed out with defeat in the Davis Cup on an emotionally-charged and tearful night in Malaga on Tuesday. The 38-year-old's legs and mind were as willing as ever but the magic was missing as he lost 6-4 6-4 to Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp in what proved to be his final competitive match. Spain's new tennis king Carlos Alcaraz levelled the quarter-final tie beating Tallon Griekspoor 7-6(0) 6-3 and had Alcaraz and Marcel Granollers then beaten Wesley Koolhof and Van de Zandschulp, Nadal would have got another chance in a semi-final on Friday against Germany or Canada. But it was not to be as Koolhof, also playing the last event of his career, played out of his skin to rip up the script and inspire the Dutch to a 7-6(4) 7-6(3) victory. Nadal willed the Spanish duo on from the sidelines, barely sitting down, but looked crestfallen as the reality that it was all over began to sink in. The Mallorcan, who featured in four Davis Cup winning teams for Spain, was tearful as the anthem was played before the tie. And after a long speech on court in front of his adoring fans, family, friends and team mates, the tears flowed again as video montage of his stupendous career was played. ""I was just a kid from a small village that had luck because my uncle was a tennis coach and had a family who supported me,"" Nadal said. ""A lot of people work hard but I am one of the lucky ones that life gave me the opportunity to live unforgettable experiences because of tennis. I just want to be remembered as a good person and a kid that followed their dreams."" Nadal had won 29 of his previous 30 singles in the team event, his only previous loss in his first tie in 2004. Last month he announced he was ending his career at the Davis Cup Final Eight, raising the possibility of one last addition to a career that was etched on the Parisian clay on which he won a record 14 French Open titles. Selected for the singles by captain David Ferrer, Nadal showed flashes of his former brilliance but in what was only his 24th match since the start of 2023, the rust showed and he struggled to hold off the powerful Dutchman who admitted afterwards he would have been cheering for Nadal had he not been required to face him on the court. When French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz levelled the tie by defeating Griekspoor he said he had ""done it for Rafa"". But he could not inspire a Spanish win in the doubles as the Dutch duo proved party poopers. Nadal had been philosophical after his singles defeat -- his first in the event since losing to Jiri Novak in 2004. ""In some ways it is good, maybe, if that was my last match because I lost my first match in the Davis Cup and I lost my last one. We close the circle,"" he said. His fans in Malaga, many of whom wore scarves with ""Gracias Rafa"" on them, stood to salute him at gone midnight in a special presentation to Spain's greatest sportsman and there was barely a dry eye in the house as he signed off. The only thing missing was his old rival and great friend Roger Federer walking on to give him a hug. Earlier in the day Federer, whose own final career match at the Laver Cup in London in 2022 ended with him and Nadal in tears and holding hands, published a letter to his pal. ""Let's start with the obvious: you beat me - a lot. More than I managed to beat you, the Swiss 20-times Grand Slam champion said. ""You challenged me in ways no one else could."""

Chasing a modest target of 118 runs, the Australian side reached the required total in just 11.2 overs, losing three wickets in the process. The defeat in the final T20I mirrored the struggles of Pakistan throughout the series, as they were bundled out for 117 runs in 18.1 overs.With seven players failing to reach double figures, the national team’s batting woes continued, leaving them unable to make a significant challenge against the hosts. Australia, opting to chase, were initially troubled by a shaky start. Openers Jack Fraser-McGurk (2) and Matthew Short (18) were dismissed early, leaving the home side at 30 for 2 within four overs. However, Australian captain Josh Inglis steadied the ship, contributing a crucial 27 off 24 balls, before being dismissed in the 10th over. Inglis and Marcus Stoinis combined for a 55-run partnership for the third wicket, with Stoinis taking charge after Inglis's departure. The Australian all-rounder unleashed a brutal assault, smashing 61* off just 27 balls, including five sixes and as many fours, leading his side to victory with ease. Stoinis’s commanding performance was the highlight of Australia’s chase, as they sealed the win in just 66 balls. For Pakistan, it was another dismal batting display. After winning the toss and opting to bat, the visitors lost early wickets, with Sahibzada Farhan (9) and Haseebullah Khan (24) failing to provide any stability at the top. Despite Babar Azam’s valiant 41, the rest of the batting line-up crumbled under pressure. Usman Khan (3), Salman Ali Agha (1), and Irfan Khan (10) all fell cheaply, and Pakistan found themselves reeling at 92/7 by the 14th over. Shaheen Afridi’s spirited cameo of 16 runs, which included two fours and a six, briefly raised hopes, but Pakistan’s collapse continued, with the final wicket falling for just 117. Aaron Hardie was the standout bowler for Australia, claiming three wickets, while Adam Zampa and Spencer Johnson picked up two each. Nathan Ellis and Xavier Bartlett also contributed with one wicket apiece. This defeat marked a series of failures for Pakistan, who have now suffered back-to-back losses in all three T20 matches, the first of which was a rain-affected encounter. Despite a series of changes, including the resting of captain Mohammad Rizwan and the debut of Jehandad Khan, Pakistan could not overcome the Australian challenge. Pakistan's lack of runs and inability to build partnerships were evident, with their middle and lower-order batting crumbling under the pressure of chasing big totals. Their lack of firepower and inability to counter Australia’s bowling attack left them exposed throughout the series. Australia’s commanding performance in this series sends a strong message as they prepare for future challenges, while Pakistan will be looking to regroup and address their shortcomings before their next international engagements.

It is pertinent to note that Indian openers have flexed their muscles against a strong Australian bowling unit, with Jaiswal not out on a 193-ball 90 and KL Rahul unbeaten on a 153-ball 62.

Ajax strolled to a 5-0 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv, Athletic Bilbao came from behind to beat Ludogorets 2-1 and Anderlecht were denied joining Lazio on top as a late own goal left them with a draw in Latvia at RFS. A brace from Amad Diallo gave United their first success in this season's competition, coming under interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy after they had drawn the previous three games with Erik ten Hag was in charge. Amad's first came five minutes after the break when he met a Bruno Fernandes cross with a looping header which found the far corner, and he added a solo second 13 minutes from time. United have six points in the standings, three behind Spurs who despite going down to 10 men almost made a dramatic comeback in Istanbul where Victor Osimhen scored twice for the hosts and Will Lankshear grabbed his first goal for Spurs before being sent off. Yunus Akgun gave Galatasaray an early lead with a stunning half-volley but Spurs levelled when Brennan Johnson's layoff across the goal left Lankshear with a simple tap-in. Radu Dragusin was caught napping at the back in the 31st minute and was dispossessed by Mauro Icardi. The ball fell to Dries Mertens who slipped a pass to Osimhen and the Nigerian striker found the bottom corner. Osimhen struck again six minutes from the break and Lankshear received his second booking on the hour mark, but 10-man Tottenham pulled a goal back when substitute Dominic Solanke back-heeled Pedro Porro's cross into the net. Lazio made it four wins from four to take control at the top of the standings thanks to an added-time goal from Pedro. The Italian side went ahead at the end of the first half through Alessio Romagnoli's header but Porto drew level through Stephen Eustaquio. It looked like Lazio would have to settle for a draw but with time running out Pedro turned a cross from Gustav Isaksen into the net. Anderlecht could have joined them on 12 points, with Mario Stroeykens putting them ahead five minutes from time but RFS snatched a draw deep into added time when Moussa N'diaye put the ball into his own net."

The 32-year-old Ortega, who joined City in 2022, is one of three goalkeepers included, alongside Stuttgart’s Alexander Nuebel and Hoffenheim’s Oliver Baumann. This marks his first call-up to the national team. Ortega’s inclusion comes as Germany’s first-choice goalkeeper, Barcelona’s Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, remains sidelined due to a serious knee injury. Despite Ter Stegen’s absence, Nagelsmann’s squad is strengthened by the return of Borussia Dortmund midfielders Julian Brandt and Felix Nmecha. Brandt, who has not featured for Germany since November 2023, and Nmecha, who earned his lone cap in March 2023 under former coach Hansi Flick, are both recalled after solid performances at the club level. The German squad will face Bosnia and Herzegovina in Freiburg on November 16, followed by an away match against Hungary in Budapest on November 19. Germany has already secured a place in the Nations League quarter-finals, having won three of their four group-stage matches, and are five points clear at the top of Group A3. Nagelsmann aims to finish the group stage with a win, especially with the home advantage in Freiburg. ""After reaching the quarter-finals early, we want to win our Nations League group – if possible in front of our fans at the home game in Freiburg,"" Nagelsmann said on Thursday. However, the squad will be without several key players due to injury, including West Ham’s Niclas Fuellkrug, Stuttgart’s Jamie Leweling, Bayern’s Aleksandar Pavlovic, and Leroy Sane, among others. Nagelsmann acknowledged the challenges posed by these absences but stressed the strength of his squad. “We have a strong squad, even if we have to restructure in some positions due to injuries,"" said Nagelsmann, adding that Sane, in particular, needs more match practice after a recent break. Meanwhile, 18-year-old midfielder Paul Wanner, currently on loan at Heidenheim from Bayern Munich, has reportedly turned down a senior call-up, opting to remain with Germany’s Under-21 team. Wanner, who is eligible to represent both Austria and Germany, has yet to decide which national team he will commit to at the senior level. The upcoming Nations League fixtures are crucial for Germany as they look to secure top spot in their group and build momentum ahead of next year’s international tournaments."

In a pre-match press conference ahead of Thursday's Europa League clash against Greek side PAOK, Van Nistelrooy confirmed that he has yet to discuss his future with Amorim, who is set to take over at Old Trafford on November 11. The Dutchman, temporarily managing United after Erik ten Hag's dismissal last week, stated, ""No, I didn’t have contact so far, there are no changes in that,"" when asked about his conversations with the Portuguese boss. Van Nistelrooy, a former United striker, has already overseen two key results in his short tenure: a 5-2 win over Leicester in the League Cup and a 1-1 draw against Chelsea in the Premier League. However, his primary focus is now on securing a crucial win in Europe. Despite United's shaky start in the Europa League, where they have drawn all three of their opening games, Van Nistelrooy emphasized that Thursday's match against PAOK at Old Trafford is his top priority. ""In the meantime, obviously there’s one thing that’s the most important for this football club now, which is getting the work done on a daily basis and in the game coming up tomorrow in Europe,"" he said. The Dutch coach, who previously expressed a desire to remain at the club, admitted that he remains uncertain about his future beyond next week. ""It’s difficult to comment on that now, I am waiting for conversations to take place,"" he added. **Meanwhile, Manchester United received positive news regarding young defender Leny Yoro’s recovery from injury.** The 18-year-old, who joined from Lille for a fee that could rise to €70 million in July, participated in team training for the first time in three months. Yoro had been sidelined due to a metatarsal injury sustained during pre-season, which required surgery. Van Nistelrooy shared his optimism about the young defender's progress, saying, ""He's been managed very well after his injury in pre-season, obviously it was going to be a long one, and it’s a big moment for him."" As Van Nistelrooy continues to manage United in the lead-up to Amorim's arrival, all eyes will be on the club's performance in their upcoming Europa League fixture against PAOK."

This time, the Real Madrid have fallen 3-1 to AC Milan in the Champions League at the Santiago Bernabeu. The result has placed immense pressure on manager Carlo Ancelotti, with Madrid's poor form threatening to derail their season. While the star-studded squad, including Kylian Mbappe, has failed to deliver, defensive and midfield issues are becoming increasingly evident. Defensive Woes and Mbappe's Dry Spell Real Madrid's defense has been leaking goals, having conceded nine in the last three matches, all played at home. Key players such as Dani Carvajal and Ferland Mendy are either injured or out of form, while Eder Militao has not looked fully fit. Ancelotti's side also struggles with a lack of cohesion in midfield, especially since the departure of Toni Kroos, whose ability to control the game's tempo is sorely missed. In attack, Kylian Mbappe's form is a growing concern. The French forward, who arrived from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, has scored only once in his last six appearances, a troubling statistic for a player expected to be Madrid's offensive focal point. Despite the Frenchman's struggles, Ancelotti has been unable to find a permanent role for Jude Bellingham, whose star performance last season has yet to be replicated this year. Ancelotti Faces Increasing Scrutiny Ancelotti admitted after the Milan defeat that the team’s lack of organization is a major issue. ""The players have to take a step forward, and I have to with them,"" the coach said. ""When there's no solidity, you have to have more organisation and work together."" With Madrid now nine points adrift of La Liga leaders Barcelona, the pressure on Ancelotti is intensifying. Former Madrid player and coach Jorge Valdano emphasized that the team's lack of balance, particularly in midfield, has been a key factor in their poor form. ""Kroos' absence was underestimated,"" Valdano said. ""Madrid are not capable of compensating for that, not even with some of the best players in the world."" Upcoming Fixtures Offer a Chance for Redemption With La Liga matches against Osasuna and Leganes approaching after the international break, Real Madrid will have a chance to recover. However, the looming fixture against Liverpool at Anfield in the Champions League promises to be another stern test for Ancelotti and his underperforming squad."

Of the 50,000 season ticket holders, club members, and executive club members polled, 52% preferred the idea of a new facility, compared to 31% who backed the redevelopment of the 114-year-old stadium. An additional 17% were undecided. The survey results came amid ongoing discussions about the future of Old Trafford, with United's ownership considering various redevelopment options. The club's cross-city rivals, Manchester City, moved out of their old Maine Road stadium in 2003, opting for the new City of Manchester Stadium, while Liverpool has chosen to redevelop Anfield rather than build a new venue. In September, United released artist's renderings of a potential Old Trafford regeneration project, suggesting that a new stadium could form part of a larger, multi-billion-pound redevelopment plan. The club’s owners are working with the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force, which includes former United defender Gary Neville and World Athletics president Sebastian Coe, to explore all options. The Task Force is reportedly focused on the possibility of building a new 100,000-capacity stadium. A final decision on the stadium's future is expected to be made in the first half of 2025, according to reports. Rick McGagh, United's director of fan engagement, emphasized the importance of listening to supporters in shaping the future of the club’s home. ""We know how important our home is to fans, and we need to listen to them and gain all their views and insights in order to develop the world-class stadium they deserve,"" McGagh said. ""We are able to view the results through different lenses to understand if our season ticket holders feel differently about anything than, say, our official members, and if younger fans have different views to older fans.""

Nadal, who has struggled with injuries over the past two years, hinted at the possibility of retirement last year. In a video message released on Thursday, he confirmed the decision, stating, ""I am here to announce my retirement from professional tennis. The past few years, especially the last two, have been difficult. I don’t think I’ve been able to play without limitations."" Nadal retires as the second-most successful men’s singles player, trailing only his long-time rival Novak Djokovic. Known as the 'King of Clay,' Nadal claimed the French Open singles title a record 14 times, winning 112 out of 116 matches at Roland Garros, an achievement unmatched by any other player at a single Grand Slam tournament. In addition to his dominance on clay, Nadal won the US Open four times, and secured two titles each at Wimbledon and the Australian Open. He also achieved Olympic glory with gold medals in both singles and doubles and contributed to Spain's four Davis Cup victories, the most recent in 2019. Nadal, along with Djokovic and 20-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer, formed the 'Big Three' that dominated men's tennis from the early 2000s and captivated millions of fans around the world.

According to details, Djokovic, seeded second behind world number one Jannik Sinner, aims to build on his emotional Paris Olympics victory and secure his first Grand Slam title of the year. Djokovic is looking to become the first man to repeat at the US Open since Roger Federer’s five consecutive wins from 2004 to 2008. ""Hopefully that changes this year,"" Djokovic said about his aspirations. The 37-year-old, whose 24 Grand Slam titles tie him with Margaret Court for the most of all time, is determined to end a year plagued by injury and potential Grand Slam absence. He will be under the lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium to face Moldovan qualifier Radu Albot. Coco Gauff, who has experienced a dip in form since winning her first major last year, will close the afternoon session against France’s 66th-ranked Varvara Gracheva. Austrian Dominic Thiem, the 2020 US Open champion, will compete against 13th-seeded American Ben Shelton, who is looking to build on his impressive semi-final run from the previous year. Thiem, who plans to retire at the end of 2024, might be making his final Grand Slam appearance if Shelton prevails. The US Open title drought for American men extends over two decades, dating back to Andy Roddick's win in 2003. US players Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe were also in action on Monday.

Serbian tennis superstar Novak Djokovic is eyeing a historic feat at the US Open as he strives to become the first man in 16 years to successfully defend his title. The second-seeded Djokovic, buoyed by his Olympic triumph in Paris, will kick off his campaign on Monday night against Moldovan qualifier Radu Albot. At 37, Djokovic is on the cusp of joining the ranks of tennis greats like Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer as one of the oldest winners of the US Open. With a victory, he could also claim the outright record for the most Grand Slam titles, surpassing the current shared record of 24 titles with Australian icon Margaret Court. Djokovic’s potential win would mark the first time since Federer’s five consecutive US Open victories from 2004-2008 that a man has repeated as champion in New York. Reflecting on this potential achievement, Djokovic said, ""I didn't know it had been that long. Hopefully, that changes this year. That’s the goal."" Securing the US Open title would extend Djokovic’s streak of years with at least one Grand Slam win to seven, having been shut out of the majors only once between 2011 and 2023.

As he expresses determination to qualify for the 2028 Olympics, Arshad reflects on his journey from humble beginnings to becoming one of Pakistan’s most celebrated athletes. While addressing a ceremony organised in his honour by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi at Governor House Peshawar, the Olympian recalled that between 2016 and 2020, he collected numerous medals in international competitions, notably breaking records at the South Asian Games in Guwahati. He further said that he had dreamt of winning a medal at the previous Tokyo Olympics, for which he worked tirelessly, despite suffering from injuries along the way. The determination paid off when he secured fifth place at the Tokyo Olympics.

Arshad’s breakthrough came when he recorded his first throw of over 80 meters in England, he recalled. Continuing his streak of impressive performances, he said he achieved a 90-meter throw in the third strike. Arshad said that later, he trained himself within just three days for the World Islamic Games and went on to win a medal. He also said that though time was short for preparation at the World Athletics Championships, his determination never wavered. His silver medal at the event was a major achievement, becoming the first Pakistani athlete to directly qualify for the Olympics.

Having thrown thrice just a day before the Olympic qualifying round, he managed to exceed 80 meters, regaining his confidence. Arshad said that in the finals of the Paris Olympics, he remained composed and confident, delivering strong throws and eventually securing a gold medal. ""I remained focused till the last throw and was successful,"" Arshad remarked. Upon his return home, Arshad said he was greeted with overwhelming love and support from his fellow countrymen. He vowed to participate in the World Athletes Championship. ""I will try hard to break my own record in the coming days,"" he expressed his resolve.

While expressing happiness over fellow athlete Arshad Nadeem's international success, Yasir stated during a press conference in Lahore, ""I am proud that Arshad Nadeem has made the country's name known worldwide. His achievements are a source of inspiration for all of us."" He said he was the current national champion, who won a bronze medal in June 2023 in the Asian Athletics Championship.  However, the national javelin thrower voiced his disappointment over unkept commitments made by the government following his own success. ""The prime minister had announced Rs5 million as a reward for winning the bronze medal in the Asian Athletics Championship, but I have not received the money yet,"" Yasir lamented. He added that despite repeated attempts to follow up on the reward, there has been no response from the authorities. Yasir also shared his regret about the lack of support and competitive opportunities, saying, ""It is a pity that I have not been given any competitions to participate in."" Despite his accolades and national standing, the athlete feels sidelined, with no clear pathway for further development or participation in international events. During the press conference, Yasir revealed that he had received offers to represent other countries in javelin competitions. ""I have offers to play for many countries,"" Yasir stated. The national javelin thrower called on the government and sports authorities to honour their promises and provide the necessary support to help athletes like him continue to represent Pakistan on the global stage. The Pakistani javelin thrower secured his bronze at the Asian Athletics Championship held in Bangkok, Thailand last year, marking the country's first and only medal in the event. Yasir achieved a throw of 79.93 meters, falling more than 10 meters short of Arshad Nadeem's personal best at the time, as the top thrower missed the competition due to injury. The gold medal went to Japan's Roderick Genki Dean, who achieved a throw of 83.15 meters, while India's DP Manu claimed silver with a distance of 81.01 meters. This medal is Pakistan's first in the Asian Athletics Championship since 1991, when the country last made it to the podium in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Yasir's performance placed Pakistan 17th on the medal table out of 42 participating nations."

The bout between the 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prizefighter Paul and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Tyson was streamed live on Netflix and played out in front of a sold-out crowd at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Those fans were left largely disappointed as Tyson showed his age and was never able to generate any offence against his younger opponent, landing just 18 punches to Paul's 78. ""First and foremost, Mike Tyson - it's an honour to be able to fight him,"" said Paul. ""It was as tough and hard as I thought it would be."" Tyson, who wore a knee brace, never mounted much of a challenge after being wobbled by some left hands in the third round but did enough defensively to avoid taking any serious damage. He admitted after the contest to fighting through a leg injury. ""Yeah, but I can't use that as an excuse. If I did, I wouldn't be in here,"" Tyson said. ""I knew he was a good fighter. He was prepared, I came to fight. I didn't prove nothing to anybody, only to myself. I'm not one of those guys that live to please the world. I'm just happy with what I can do."" Tyson, one of the most fearsome heavyweight champions of all time during his heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s, was in his first professional fight in nearly 20 years. He was non-committal when asked if he would return to the ring again. ""I don't know. It depends on the situation,"" he said. Paul (11-1) said he can now fight anyone he wants, possibly even Mexican Canelo Alvarez, after being the main attraction in the mega event that brought out a star-studded crowd and 72,300 fight fans to the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. ""This is the biggest event, over 120 million people on Netflix. We crashed the site, The biggest U.S. boxing gate, $20 million, in U.S. history, and everyone is next on the list."" In the co-main event earlier in the evening, Ireland's Katie Taylor retained her super lightweight title by beating Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano in a controversial unanimous decision after a violent affair. Serrano came forward throughout the fight but their heads crashed together hard in the early stages, resulting in a deep cut over Serrano's right eye. The referee later took a point off Taylor for head butts. In the end all three judges scored it 95-94 for Taylor, who denied accusations from Serrano's corner that she was fighting dirty. Taylor won the pair's previous meeting at New York's Madison Square Garden in April 2022 and said there would be a third meeting."

The win helped India seal the series 3-1, ending their tour on a high note. The visitors’ innings was built around Sanju Samson (109* off 56 balls) and Tilak Varma (120* off 47 balls), who were unstoppable in a partnership that dominated the South African bowlers. The pair’s explosive batting turned the match into a run-fest. Their combined effort included 15 sixes and 15 fours, with Varma’s strike rate an astonishing 255.31, while Samson maintained an equally remarkable 194.64. The South African bowlers had no answers to the onslaught, with Lutho Sipamla (1/58) and Gerald Coetzee (0/43) struggling to contain the Indian batters. Despite a brief glimmer of hope when Abhishek Sharma (36 off 18 balls) was dismissed, India’s total surged, leaving the hosts with an insurmountable target. In reply, South Africa’s chase crumbled under the weight of India’s huge score. The home side dismissed for just 148 in 18.2 overs as India’s bowlers led by Arshdeep Singh (3/20), Varun Chakravarthy (2/42), and Axar Patel (2/6) had decimated the South African batting order. Ryan Rickelton, Reeza Hendricks and Heinrich Klaasen were all dismissed cheaply, with Tristan Stubbs (43) and David Miller (36) the only significant contributors for the Proteas. Despite a late flurry from Marco Jansen (29* off 12 balls), South Africa could not recover from an early collapse, with India’s bowlers maintaining tight lines and getting crucial wickets at regular intervals. India’s dominant performance in the match was also reflected in individual honors with Tilak Varma named ""player of the match for his blistering 120 and ""player of the series"" for his overall outstanding contributions across the four games.

The 36-year-old fast bowler, who has claimed 770 wickets across all formats, is preparing to retire after the series, which begins next week in Christchurch. However, Southee has confirmed that he will make himself available for selection if New Zealand qualifies for the World Test Championship (WTC) final in 2025. Southee, who made his Test debut in 2008, expressed contentment with his decision to retire, stating that playing for the Black Caps has been ""the greatest honour and privilege."" Reflecting on his career, he noted that facing England in the series – an opponent against whom he began his Test journey – felt like the perfect way to close this chapter. The final Test is scheduled to take place at his home ground, Seddon Park in Hamilton, further adding to the significance of the moment. Despite a recent dip in form, with Southee struggling to make an impact in New Zealand’s previous home summer and taking just six wickets in four Tests, he remains a key figure in the squad for the England series. He will be part of the 14-man squad announced by New Zealand Cricket, which also includes two uncapped players, Otago's Jacob Duffy and Wellington’s Nathan Smith. Smith, the leading wicket-taker in New Zealand's Plunket Shield, earned his first Test call-up after a stellar domestic season. Former captain Kane Williamson has also been included in the squad, having recovered from a groin injury that kept him out of the recent tour of India. The Black Caps' selectors have opted to bolster their pace attack, recalling spinners Ajaz Patel and Ish Sodhi to make way for seam-bowling options, including all-rounders Glenn Phillips and Mitch Santner, who will feature in the second and third Tests. The England series is crucial for New Zealand's World Test Championship hopes. A strong performance could propel them into the top two spots needed to secure a place in the WTC final at Lord’s in June 2025. With New Zealand currently sitting fourth in the standings, just behind Australia, India, and Sri Lanka, the Black Caps are eyeing a WTC final berth as they bid to add another international title to their collection. New Zealand selector Sam Wells acknowledged the significance of the series, not just for the team’s WTC aspirations but also as a fitting farewell to one of the country's greatest-ever cricketers. ""It’s obviously a big series for the side in terms of the World Test Championship, and to also now be farewelling someone like Tim Southee only raises it up further,” Wells said. ""I am sure the team and the public will want to give Tim a fitting send-off."" "

The stance contradicts the International Cricket Council's (ICC) policy of separating sports from politics, while potentially influencing Pakistan's established right to host international events despite demonstrated improvements in security infrastructure and successful hosting of recent tournaments. Economic implications of such decisions extend beyond the playing field, affecting sponsorship revenues, broadcasting rights, and tourism income associated with major tournaments. The Pakistan Super League and World Cup qualifiers hosted by Pakistan have shown the country's capability to organize international cricket events successfully. The boycott's impact reaches beyond immediate sporting concerns, affecting player development opportunities and fan engagement. Cricket enthusiasts from both nations traditionally anticipate these high-stakes matches, which have historically served as a bridge for cultural exchange. Regional cricket development faces challenges as such decisions potentially set precedents for other nations.

The event, marking Netflix's first venture into the sporting world, has generated widespread attention, drawing fans and critics alike. Paul, 27, has quickly risen through the ranks of boxing, turning his early fame from social media into a legitimate sports career. With a professional record of 10-1, including seven knockouts, the Ohio native’s momentum was solidified with a decisive victory over Mike Perry, a veteran of UFC and Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, this past July. However, standing opposite Paul in the ring is the legendary Tyson, now 58, whose unparalleled career has spanned decades and whose ferocity in the ring remains etched in history. This fight marks Tyson's return to the professional boxing scene for the first time since his loss to Kevin McBride in June 2005. Tyson, who had retired shortly after that defeat, made his return to the sport with an exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr. in 2020. Despite being 58 years old, Tyson, with a career record of 50-6 and 44 knockouts, is determined to silence critics who question his ability to compete at the highest level. ""I’m just ready to fight,"" Tyson stated firmly at a media event on Wednesday evening. His calm demeanor and limited remarks contrasted with Paul’s more boisterous presence. While Tyson kept his focus solely on Paul, the 27-year-old Paul was in his element, eager to talk up his upcoming fight. ""Excitement. Big fights, big knockouts,"" Paul said, emphasizing his intent to bring new energy to the sport. Paul has repeatedly stated that he aims to become the biggest superstar in boxing, contrasting his approach to that of fighters like Floyd Mayweather Jr., who Paul criticized for his more tactical, less exciting bouts. In a display of confidence, Paul issued a series of spontaneous bets to the other fighters at the event, offering to wager fight purses and even as little as $20 if he were to lose to Tyson. The media event also showcased the star power of other boxers, but all eyes were on the showdown between Tyson and Paul, which has captured the public’s imagination in the lead-up to the bout. Tyson, however, is not fazed by the circus-like atmosphere surrounding the fight. ""The people speak for themselves,"" he remarked, focusing solely on his opponent, as he treated Paul with the same respect as any other boxer. Tyson’s return to the ring has sparked debate, but for the former champion, the fight is about more than proving his critics wrong—it’s about honoring his legacy and stepping back into the ring on his terms. The fight, initially scheduled for July 20, was postponed after Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up. Now, with the event set to take place at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, a sell-out crowd of 70,000 is expected to witness this high-profile matchup. Despite the enormous turnout, limited tickets remain available. The main card for the event begins at 8 p.m. ET and includes a co-feature rematch between Ireland’s Katie Taylor and Puerto Rico’s Amanda Serrano for the undisputed super lightweight world title. Their previous bout in May 2022 at Madison Square Garden was a thrilling contest, with Taylor narrowly edging out Serrano by split decision after ten rounds."

According to sources, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has rejected the proposed “Hybrid model” suggested by the ICC as an alternative venue arrangement, prompting Pakistan to reach out to ICC member states directly. The PCB has decided to send formal letters to the cricket boards of participating nations, taking them into confidence regarding the hosting status and stressing Pakistan’s capacity to host major international tournaments safely. The list includes countries whose teams have recently visited Pakistan, such as Bangladesh, Australia, New Zealand, England, Afghanistan, and South Africa, demonstrating Pakistan’s credibility as a host. The Pakistani government also plans to communicate with other nations through diplomatic channels to garner support. ICC voting process If the issue escalates, it could lead to a formal vote within the ICC. For Pakistan to retain hosting rights in such a scenario, it would need a minimum of 8 out of 12 votes from the member countries.

The ICC informed PCB last week that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) would not be participating in the marquee tournament in Pakistan, citing lack of government clearance from New Delhi.

Naqvi rejected suggestions of a ""hybrid model,"" where India would play its matches at a neutral venue, such as the UAE, saying, “There have been no discussions about hosting the tournament in a hybrid format.” In response to the BCCI’s request for a neutral venue, Naqvi noted that hosting the entire tournament outside Pakistan would undermine the event. ""Almost every country wants the tournament to be played in Pakistan, and it will be disappointing if they don’t come,"" he remarked. The PCB has hinted at considering a withdrawal from events in India if the Champions Trophy is relocated. The PCB’s stance is further bolstered by recent successful tours from other cricketing nations, indicating that Pakistan is a secure host. The board is unwilling to accept ""security concerns"" as a justification, especially given its reciprocal participation in the recent ODI World Cup held in India. This impasse has reportedly delayed the official schedule announcement, initially expected this week.

Noman paid tribute to his teammates, who helped Pakistan fight back from an early defeat to clinch the series against England.

Speaking on his radio show, Clarke accused Australia of ""not caring"" about the outcome, pointing to CA’s decision to rest prominent players, including skipper Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Steve Smith, and Marnus Labuschagne for the final match. The former skipper said this decision likely influenced the series outcome and affected the team's reputation. ""I feel like we obviously don’t care about losing that series. If you’re not going to care, we’re not going to care,"" he remarked. Australia's approach, Clarke argued, suggested they were prioritizing the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a five-match Test series against India starting 11 days after the ODI series. Key players Travis Head and Mitch Marsh were also absent from the entire series due to personal commitments, with both on paternal leave. Clarke questioned the logic of resting players despite the 11-day gap before the first Test in Perth. ""I'm just a bit confused,"" he said.

Barcelona's Spain midfielder Aitana Bonmati won the women's award for a second time. Rodri, a first-time winner of the award, was instrumental in helping his team win an unprecedented fourth successive Premier League trophy last season. He was also named best player at this year's European Championship after Spain lifted a record-extending fourth title. The 28-year-old Madrid native is the first defensive midfielder to win the Ballon d'Or since Lothar Matthaus in 1990 and the third Spaniard to claim the prize after Alfredo Di Stefano (1957 and 1959) and Luis Suarez (1960). While the award has been dominated by Spanish league players, no Spaniard had won since Barcelona great Luis Suarez more than 60 years ago, despite Spain's ""golden generation"" that won the 2010 World Cup, the 2008 and 2012 Euros. But Rodri, the player City coach Pep Guardiola said is ""the best midfielder in the world"", finally ended that run with a unique skillset that has made his club the dominant force in England and helped Spain rule Europe again. ""Today is not a victory for me, it is for Spanish football, for so many players who have not won it and have deserved it, like (Andres) Iniesta, Xavi (Hernandez), Iker (Casillas), Sergio Busquets, so many others. It is for Spanish football and for the figure of the midfielder,"" Rodri said on stage at the ceremony. ""Today many friends have written to me and have told me that football has won, for giving visibility to so many midfielders who have a job in the shadows and today it is coming to light. ""I'm a regular guy with values, who studies, who tries to do things right and doesn't try to follow the stereotypes and even so I have been able to get to the top, and it is thanks to all of you."" Rodri became the third person not named Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo to claim the award since 2008. It was the first time since 2003 in which neither Messi nor Ronaldo made the final 30-man list of nominees. Portugal's Ronaldo, who has won the award five times and was the last Premier League player to win it in 2008, also failed to receive a nomination last year after moving to Saudi Arabia. Messi, who won for a record eighth time in 2023, missed out despite Argentina's Copa America triumph. Rodri has only lost a match once in the past 18 months -- City's surprise FA Cup final defeat by Manchester United last season. Earlier, Rodri's national teammate Lamine Yamal won the Kopa Trophy for the best Under-21 player by helping Spain to a perfect Euro 2024 campaign, winning all seven games en route to lifting the trophy. Bonmati won the women's Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year while compatriot Jennifer Hermoso was awarded the Socrates Award for her role in the fight for women's rights in football and her courageous stance against sexism in sport. Real Madrid had decided to boycott the ceremony in anticipation of Vinicius not winning the men's award.

The first half saw a resilient Madrid side, but they faltered after halftime when Robert Lewandowski scored twice, followed by goals from Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, sealing the emphatic win for the Catalans. The loss has sent shockwaves through Madrid, prompting questions about the team's future. Mbappe, who had two goals disallowed for offside, expressed visible frustration and has struggled to find his place within the squad, netting only six league goals compared to Lewandowski’s impressive tally of 14. Despite the defeat, Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti urged his team not to despair. ""We don't have to throw everything in the bin,"" he stated, emphasizing the need for resilience and learning from the experience. The team will need to regroup quickly to avoid letting Barcelona pull away in the title race. With inconsistencies in their midfield and a tactical reshuffle to accommodate Mbappe, Ancelotti faces crucial decisions ahead. As the season progresses, Madrid must find a way to regain their form and reclaim their status as title contenders."

Now 37 and retired, Bonucci reflected on his illustrious career, which included battles against many footballing greats, including both Ronaldo—his teammate during a three-year stint at Juventus—and Messi. However, it was Zapata, who currently plays for Torino after a notable tenure at Atalanta, that kept Bonucci awake at night before matches. ""The one that hit me the most and the one I had more fun with was Luis Suarez because he hit and got hit without any problem. My nightmare, who didn't make me sleep at night, was Zapata. God, before games against his Atalanta side, I couldn't sleep at night. His power and physicality made him my nightmare,"" Bonucci shared during an appearance on Sky Calcio Club. Bonucci went on to express his gratitude for the opportunity to face many champions throughout his career, including Didier Drogba, Fernando Torres, and, of course, the iconic duo of Ronaldo and Messi.

This marks an important step in his preparation for the Paris Olympics. In his first singles match since a first-round exit at Roland Garros on May 27, the 38-year-old Nadal secured a 6-3, 6-4 victory despite wet conditions. Both Nadal and the 21-year-old Borg, ranked 461 in the world, were wild card entries in this Swedish clay-court tournament. Despite an early scare with the former world number one slipping on the wet white line, Nadal broke for 3-1, hitting four aces to take the first set in 43 minutes. An immediate break in the second set gave Nadal control, and he sealed the match on his second match point after 1 hour and 25 minutes on court, marking his eighth ATP tour match win this season. ""It's good, I'm finally defending my title,"" joked Nadal, recalling his last appearance in Bastad when he won the title at age 19 in 2005. ""I haven't been playing a lot of tennis in the last few months. The feelings are great, playing in front of a full crowd means a lot to me and I'm lucky to have been able to play without rain. Even in the tougher moments, I have been able to keep going with the help of the team, but of course, the fans have a huge impact on that. They give me amazing energy."" The 22-time Grand Slam winner also praised his young rival, saying, ""It's a huge honour to play against the son of one of the biggest legends in the history of our sport. I think he played quite well, he has a great future ahead. I wish him all the very best."" Next, Nadal will face fifth seed Cameron Norrie in the second round after the British player defeated Slovak Jozef Kovalik 7-6 (7/4), 6-4. Nadal skipped Wimbledon to focus on the Olympics, which will be held at Roland Garros, where he has won 14 French Open titles. On Monday, Nadal also teamed up with Casper Ruud for a doubles win on clay in Bastad, just two weeks ahead of the Paris Games.

Despite holding the world number one spot and aiming for a fourth Roland Garros title, as well as a record-extending 25th major, Djokovic is experiencing his most difficult run since 2018. At 37, Djokovic has not secured a title in 2024, with his best performances being semi-final appearances at the Australian Open and the Monte Carlo Masters. He also endured an unusual incident in Rome, where he was accidentally struck on the head by a metal water bottle, leading to nausea and dizziness. Last week in Geneva, Djokovic was ousted by Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic, compounded by a stomach ailment. Reflecting on his season, Djokovic described his challenges as ""bumps on the road"" and remained forward-looking. He downplayed his struggles, avoiding detailed explanations and emphasising his focus on the future: ""What has happened, happened, and it's in the past. I know exactly what I need to do in a Grand Slam environment."" Djokovic's first-round opponent is French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert, whom he defeated in their only previous meeting at the Paris Masters in 2013. Herbert, ranked 142, has not won a main tour match this year. In the women's draw, Aryna Sabalenka, a two-time Australian Open champion and world number two, begins her quest for a first Roland Garros final. Sabalenka has reached the semi-finals in each of the past six Grand Slams and remains the only woman to have defeated world number one Iga Swiatek in a clay final since 2019. Sabalenka credits Swiatek for motivating her to improve, noting significant progress in her game due to this rivalry. Meanwhile, fourth seed Elena Rybakina, with her best Roland Garros result being a quarterfinal in 2021, faces Greet Minnen of Belgium. Also in action is Argentine qualifier Roman Andres Burruchaga, the son of Jorge Burruchaga, who scored the winning goal for Argentina in the 1986 World Cup final. Ranked 144, Roman makes his Grand Slam debut against Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff. As the French Open progresses, both Djokovic and Sabalenka are poised to overcome their recent challenges and leave their mark on Roland Garros."

The 22-time Grand Slam champion, who first triumphed at Roland Garros as a teenager in 2005, will celebrate his 38th birthday during the tournament. Currently ranked 276th in the world, Nadal has been plagued by injuries, playing only 15 matches since January last year and missing 12 Grand Slam tournaments throughout his career. Drawn to face world number four Alexander Zverev in the first round, Nadal enters the tournament unseeded and uncertain of his physical capabilities. ""I'm going to play the tournament thinking that I can give my all, 100 percent,"" Nadal remarked after a recent second-round exit in Rome. His record at Roland Garros is unmatched, boasting 112 wins against just three losses, two to rival Novak Djokovic. Nadal remains highly esteemed, evidenced by the 6,000 fans who attended his first training session at Roland Garros. Fellow Grand Slam winners Stan Wawrinka and Daniil Medvedev practiced with Nadal, with Wawrinka noting Nadal's enduring strength and Medvedev expressing relief at not facing him. As Nadal prepares for his potential final act in Paris, Novak Djokovic also faces uncertainty. The defending champion, with 24 Grand Slam titles to his name, has not won a title this season and suffered a shock semi-final loss in Geneva. Djokovic's campaign begins against home wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Nadal and Djokovic's dominance at Roland Garros is historic, with at least one of them featuring in every final since 2009."

The world number one could also achieve a milestone by becoming the first player to clinch three consecutive women's titles in Paris since Justine Henin in 2007 when the French Open begins on Sunday. Swiatek enters the tournament as the strong favourite, having dominated the clay court season with WTA 1000 victories in Madrid and Rome. Achieving a rare Madrid-Rome-Roland Garros treble, accomplished only by Serena Williams, is within reach for the 22-year-old Pole, who is set to face French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean in the first round. Despite acknowledging the pressure and nerves, Swiatek remains confident in her current form and preparation. ""There is a lot of pressure...but I wouldn't say I'm more nervous than usual. I'm also pretty confident with how I'm playing right now and with the work we have been doing,"" she told reporters. Swiatek’s impressive season includes four WTA 1000 titles, bringing her career total to 10, and putting her on a fast track towards record achievements. With four Grand Slam titles under her belt, Swiatek aims to join the elite group of Chris Evert, Steffi Graf, and Justine Henin, who have each won the Coupe Suzanne-Lenglen four times in the Open era. However, Aryna Sabalenka, the biggest obstacle in Swiatek's path, will be seeking redemption after a narrow loss in Madrid and a decisive defeat in Rome. The Belarusian, a two-time reigning Australian Open champion, has consistently reached at least the semi-finals in recent Grand Slam events and is the only woman to beat Swiatek in a final on clay in the past year. Both Swiatek and Sabalenka downplay their rivalry's distraction but acknowledge its role in pushing them to improve. ""For sure, this rivalry is exciting for the fans. I think we both kind of need each other to grow,"" Swiatek noted. Sabalenka echoed this sentiment, admitting Swiatek motivates her to enhance her game. Adding to the competitive mix are Elena Rybakina and Coco Gauff. Rybakina, though not consistent recently, remains a formidable opponent, while Gauff, aiming for a better run after her 2022 French Open final loss to Swiatek, begins her campaign against Russian qualifier Julia Avdeeva.

Grammy-winning R&B artist H.E.R teased the Mission Impossible soundtrack as Cruise made his leap, drawing gasps from spectators as he dropped 50 metres to the floor of the Stade de France, in the finale to a ceremony that blended the traditional, the obscure and the razzle dazzle of Tinseltown.  While Paris used iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles to win the hearts of Olympians and spectators alike, LA was swift to turn to its star draw: A-list celebrities. Paris was bringing down the curtain on an Olympic Games that brought scintillating sport to the heart of the capital, breathing new life into an Olympic brand hurt by the difficulties of Rio de Janeiro's 2016 Games and the soulless spirit of Tokyo's COVID-hit event. Even Parisians were carried away by the Olympic fervour.  ""We wanted to dream. We got Leon Marchand,"" Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet told the crowd, referring to the French swimmer who won four golds. ""From one day to the next Paris became a party and France found itself. From a country of grumblers, we became a country of frenzied fans."" The two weeks of sporting drama saw China and the United States duke it out for top spot in the medal table right down to the last event. Echoing the heartache delivered to France by the United States in the men's basketball final, the American women's basketball side handed France a gut-wrenching one-point defeat to earn a 40th gold medal and top spot on the medal table.  As the world emerged from the COVID pandemic in 2022, Paris had promised an Olympic ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and to provide the stage for a carefree Games. But Russia's war in Ukraine on Europe's eastern flank, conflict in the Middle East, and France's heightened state of security alert loomed large as the Games got under way. International Committee President Thomas Bach saluted the athletes as he declared the Games closed.  ""During all this time, you lived peacefully together under one roof in the Olympic Village.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has acknowledged Paris has set a high standard. But the City of Angels has billed itself as a beacon of diversity and will have Hollywood to fall back on. ""They've got a high bar to reach. A lot of work to do,"" said James Rutledge, 59, a former banker wearing a Team USA t-shirt outside the Stade de France. ""Hollywood next? That's something to play with."" France will take away fond sporting memories.

After England strolled to victory in the opening T20 at the Kensington Oval, West Indies' lower order again dragged them to a defendable total on the same ground 24 hours later, with 32 runs coming off the final two overs to help the hosts post 158. Phil Salt went from an unbeaten centurion on Saturday to out first ball as England's reply initially stuttered, but Buttler, on his second start after a lengthy injury absence, plundered six sixes to give the tourists control of the series. A Liam Livingstone six sealed the comprehensive success, with England able to wrap up what would be a first white-ball series win in the Caribbean since 2019 in Saint Lucia on Thursday with two matches to spare. ""It is great to spend time in the middle,"" Buttler said. ""I was a bit scratchy for the first few balls but I managed to come through that period and really enjoyed it. It was great to be back out there. ""I have played for a while and batted in lots different positions. I am just waiting to see what happens and playing what is in front of me."" With Buttler winning the toss and putting the hosts in to bat first, frontline fast bowler Jofra Archer was quickly back among the wickets after a disappointing first T20I, helping restrict West Indies to 35-3 inside the first four overs. A useful 43 from skipper Rovman Powell led the hosts' recovery, but after he was clean bowled by Dan Mousley, the England rookie's first T20I wicket, West Indies were up against it to remain in the contest. Those late runs from tailenders, a rapid 22 off 12 balls from Romario Shepherd the pick of the contributions, put the pressure back on England. Pressure that seemed to get to Salt as he followed the heroics from the previous night by giving away his wicket off the first ball of the tourists' reply. Buttler, back in the side after a four-month calf injury layoff, steadied the ship alongside opener Will Jacks, the pair putting on 128 for the second wicket before Jacks fell for 38. The captain followed Jacks back to the pavilion in the same Shepherd over, but an unbeaten 23 from Livingstone ensured the hosts were never able to make any further inroads, England sealing victory with five overs to spare.

"751","Sports","Sinner opens ATP Finals campaign with win over De Minaur","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323823-sinner-opens-atp-finals-campaign-with-win-over-de-minaur","World number one and home favourite Jannik Sinner began his bid to win the ATP Finals for the first time with a 6-3 6-4 defeat of tournament debutant Alex de Minaur on Sunday. Sinner, runner-up to Novak Djokovic in the prestigious year-ending tournament last year, dropped behind early in the first set but quickly hit back to dominate the contest. The Italian, who won this year's Australian and U.S. Open titles to open his Grand Slam account, completed victory with an ace to make it eight wins out of eight against De Minaur. Earlier in the Ilie Nastase Group American Taylor Fritz beat Russian Daniil Medvedev 6-4 6-3. Sinner, 23, had not played a competitive match for four weeks since taking the title in Shanghai, his seventh of the season, and there was some early rust as he dropped serve to trail 2-1 in the opening set. But he broke back immediately and his power from the baseline proved too much for De Minaur thereafter as he was roared on by the crowd in the 13,000-seater Inalpi Arena. ""Considering I hadn't played for four weeks I'm very happy,"" Sinner said at court side. ""I started off with some unforced errors at the beginning of the match but I stayed there mentally knowing that at some point my tennis would arrive. ""It arrived quite early and started to return very well. Today I'm pleased with the win and it will give me confidence."" Sinner is hoping to cap a superb year on the court, although a cloud still hangs over the Italian who was cleared of wrongdoing by an independent tribunal after testing positive for the anabolic agent clostebol in March this year. The tribunal, organised by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), accepted Sinner's explanation that the banned substance entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has since appealed the 'no fault or negligence' decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Earlier in the day former ATP Finals champion Medvedev lost his cool and risked getting defaulted because of his bizarre antics during his defeat by Fritz . The 2020 champion lost his composure after a string of double faults in the first set as Fritz beat the Russian for the first time in his career. Medvedev served three double faults to drop serve at 4-5 in the first set and was so incensed that he smashed his racket. He lost his cool again in the second set and began to unravel, breaking a microphone with his racket while he was also given a point penalty. Bizarrely he later faced a Fritz serve holding the racket the wrong way round. ""I get angry, frustrated. This time completely with myself, not with anyone. Just with myself,"" Medvedev told reporters. Monday's action includes Spain's Carlos Alcaraz up against Norway's Casper Ruud in the John Newcombe group while Germany's Alexander Zverev plays Andrey Rublev."

Meanwhile, Ipswich Town stunned Tottenham 2-1 for their first Premier League win in over two decades. In a match that marked Bruno Fernandes' 250th appearance for Manchester United, the Portuguese midfielder played a pivotal role, scoring his fourth goal in as many games. Fernandes’ neat link-up with Amad Diallo set up the first goal before his burst into the box deflected a shot off Leicester defender Victor Kristiansen for an own goal, doubling United’s lead. Diallo, who scored twice in a 2-0 Europa League win earlier in the week, added a third with a stunning strike from Alejandro Garnacho's assist to complete the 3-0 victory. United, who remain in 13th place, now sit just three points shy of fifth place in a congested Premier League table. Van Nistelrooy, who stepped in after Erik ten Hag's sacking, handed over the reins to Ruben Amorim, who will take charge following the international break. Ipswich Town claimed their first Premier League win in 22 years, defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Sammie Szmodics opened the scoring with a remarkable overhead kick, followed by a close-range finish from Liam Delap. Although Rodrigo Bentancur pulled one back for Spurs, Ipswich held firm to secure all three points. The victory saw them climb out of the relegation zone, moving ahead of Crystal Palace, while Spurs slipped to 10th place after their fifth defeat in 11 games. Nottingham Forest’s impressive run of three consecutive wins came to a halt at home, with Newcastle United emerging 3-1 victors. Forest took the lead with a towering header from Murillo, but the Magpies responded in the second half. Alexander Isak's header began the fightback, followed by a brilliant strike from Joelinton, and a third goal from Harvey Barnes sealed the win. The result lifted Newcastle to eighth in the table while Forest remained in third, just behind Liverpool and Manchester City. Arsenal, currently 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, face a crucial away fixture against Chelsea, hoping to snap a three-game winless streak in the Premier League. Captain Martin Ødegaard, making his first appearance in two months, will be key to Arsenal's hopes of a revival. With both teams desperate for a win, the London derby promises to be a pivotal moment in their respective title challenges.  "

"756","Sports","Liverpool go five points clear as Man City lose again","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323774-liverpool-go-five-points-clear-as-man-city-lose-again","Liverpool opened a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 home defeat of Aston Villa after Manchester City slumped to a fourth successive defeat as Brighton & Hove Albion hit back to beat champions 2-1 at home on Saturday. Arne Slot's side made it nine wins from their opening 11 league games with a Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah scoring the goals in a deadly demonstration of counter-attacking. City took the lead with Erling Haaland scoring his 12th league goal of the campaign but late goals by Joao Pedro and Matt O'Riley stunned Pep Guardiola's side who enter the international break with much to ponder. Liverpool head into the international break with 28 points from 11 games with City on 23 while Brighton and Hove Albion are in fourth place on 19 points. Third-placed Nottingham Forest could move to 22 points if they beat Newcastle United on Sunday. Dutchman Slot has enjoyed a remarkable start at Liverpool with 15 wins from his first 17 in charge since replacing the seemingly irreplaceable Juergen Klopp. His style is more pragmatic than Klopp's but no less spectacular at times, as they showed on Saturday. Nunez opened the scoring after 20 minutes when Liverpool broke at lightning pace following an Aston Villa corner and after Mohamed Salah was bundled over by Leon Bailey, Nunez took matters into his own hands to round Emiliano Martinez and blast home a shot from a narrow angle. Villa, whose season has hit a rough patch, were denied an equaliser by some excellent saves by Caoimhin Kelleher but were floored late on when after another counter-attack from deep in Liverpool's half, Salah burst clear to finish in style. ""In general we had control over the game and scored from two counter-attacks which is maybe not what we would expect,"" Slot said. ""Margins are small, we have a margin but it is small. ""There are many challenges to come for us."" Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva said after the 4-1 thrashing away to Sporting in the Champions League in midweek that the team were in a dark place. And despite Haaland's early goal at Brighton, the gloom deepened as they lost their grip on the game with Joao Pedro and O'Riley capping memorable night for the Seagulls. ""I will reflect in these ten days. Clear our heads, players come back fit, this is the target,"" Guardiola, whose only similar run in all competitions was at Bayern Munich in 2015 when he suffered three back-to-back defeats and a penalty shoot-out loss in the German Cup, told reporters. ""We try to analyse how we perform - four in a row. Okay. The question is how we are playing. The level we're playing is really good in certain moments but we are not able to continue."" It is also the first time City have lost four successive games in all competitions in 18 years. Fulham climbed to seventh after a 2-0 win away at London rivals Crystal Palace with goals by Emile Smith Rowe and Harry Wilson. The hosts were reduced to 10 men after Daichi Kamada was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle. Brentford twice came from behind to beat Bournemouth 3-2 thanks to a brace from Yoane Wissa. Wolverhampton Wanderers finally tasted victory after a wretched start to the season as they beat fellow strugglers Southampton 2-0 to climb off the foot of the table. Pablo Sarabia scored after two minutes -- Wolves' fastest goal in a Premier League match -- and Matheus Cunha wrapped up the points to the relief of manager Gary O'Neil. Wolves moved up to 18th place with six points with Southampton now bottom on four. Ipswich Town, now the only team in the Premier League without a win, have five points ahead of their visit to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. West Ham United and Everton played out a dull 0-0 draw at the London Stadium."

Despite the early setbacks, Pakistan reached the target in just 26.5 overs, finishing at 143/2. Pakistan: (26.5/50 ov, T:141) 143/2 Australia:  (31.5/50 ov) 140 Haris Rauf is the Player of the Match and Player of the Series. ""This means a lot to Pakistan, because we've been struggling a lot for the last few months,"" he says. ""We're playing for the fans who come to the ground every time to support us. We've been practicing a lot the past few weeks, talking among the fast bowlers, communicating well, and it's paying off.""  Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan were instrumental in the chase, with Rizwan remaining unbeaten on 29 off 24 balls and Azam contributing 23 runs. The partnership between Rizwan and Azam, which amassed 58 runs, guided Pakistan to a comfortable win. With an impressive run rate of 5.32, Pakistan’s chase never seemed in doubt, and the team cruised to victory with 4 wickets remaining. Australia’s total of 140, after being bowled out earlier in the match, proved insufficient as Pakistan’s batting line-up dominated the chase. Despite the best efforts of Adam Zampa and Aaron Hardie, who both bowled well, Australia’s defense was broken down by Pakistan’s disciplined and determined batting.  With this win, Pakistan has taken a significant step in the series, continuing their excellent performance in the tour. In the third ODI of Pakistan’s tour of Australia, Pakistan’s bowlers dominated, dismissing Australia for just 140 runs in 31.5 overs. Pakistan, who opted to field first, now require 141 runs to secure a come-from-behind series victory.  Shaheen Shah Afridi was outstanding, claiming three wickets, including the final two, to wrap up Australia’s innings. He bowled Lance Morris with a full delivery that moved away off the pitch, hitting the off-stump—a delivery that would trouble even top batters. Earlier, Afridi had Sean Abbott caught at mid-on by Haris Rauf after Abbott managed 30 runs from 41 balls. Naseem Shah also delivered a crucial spell, taking three wickets and maintaining pressure on the Australian lineup. Australia’s batting struggled, with no partnerships forming to counter the Pakistani bowlers.  With a win probability of over 96% in Pakistan’s favor, they will now look to chase down the modest target and clinch the series. In the third ODI of the Pakistan tour of Australia, held at Perth on November 10, Pakistan’s bowlers made an impressive start after opting to field first. Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah struck early, keeping Australia under pressure with their disciplined bowling. At 52/2 after 9.3 overs, Australia's scoring rate remained steady but cautious, with Pakistan’s attack demonstrating sharp control. Matthew Short, currently on 19 off 20 balls, has managed to strike two boundaries but is playing watchfully against the Pakistani pace duo. Shaheen Afridi, with figures of 1/20 from his five overs, has been particularly effective, bowling tight lines and extracting movement, troubling the Australian batters. Naseem Shah also claimed an early wicket, ending his four-over spell with 1/28, while Mohammad Hasnain has just joined the attack, conceding only four runs in his opening three balls. Shaheen’s brilliant delivery to dismiss Aaron Hardie for 12 epitomized Pakistan’s dominance. The Australians have been unable to fully break free, as Afridi and Naseem consistently created opportunities with balls that beat the bat, keeping the scoring rate in check. With Australia’s top order unable to capitalize on scoring chances, Pakistan will look to continue building pressure as the innings progresses. Their disciplined attack so far has been a standout, with fans and analysts praising the team's bowling performance as one of their best efforts in the series so far."

The Champions Trophy is set to be held in Pakistan from February 19 to March 9, 2025, marking the first time in nearly three decades that Pakistan has hosted a major ICC event. With only three months remaining before the tournament, the BCCI’s stance has complicated preparations. According to ESPNcricinfo revealed that the BCCI communicated its decision to the ICC after receiving advice from the Indian government against traveling to Pakistan. However, it remains unclear whether this notification was formal or informal, and the ICC has reportedly sought written confirmation before relaying the decision to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Earlier, PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi responded firmly, emphasizing the need for official communication on India’s refusal. ""If there are issues, they should be provided in writing.We have not discussed or accepted any hybrid model, nor has it been communicated to us,” Naqvi stated while addressing the press at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium. Naqvi further hinted at potential repercussions, saying future Pakistan tours to India could be subjected to similar government approvals, adding that “great gestures” were previously made by Pakistan, such as their participation in the 2023 ODI World Cup in India despite strained ties. Hybrid model on the table With India's absence from Pakistan, the ICC faces a logistical challenge to ensure the participation of all eight teams, which include Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and South Africa. The ICC has reportedly begun considering a hybrid model, reminiscent of the 2023 Asia Cup structure, where India’s matches were hosted in Sri Lanka instead of Pakistan. Naqvi, however, rejected the idea, affirming the PCB's readiness to discuss alternatives only upon receiving formal notice from the ICC or BCCI. Although a hybrid hosting model is not unprecedented, its implementation could pose significant challenges, particularly with the tournament’s condensed format of group-stage matches, semi-finals, and a final. The UAE and Sri Lanka have been shortlisted as potential co-hosts, with the UAE holding a slight edge due to geographic proximity and prior hosting experience for Pakistan. This development underscores the challenges cricket faces in bridging India-Pakistan diplomatic strains. India has not visited Pakistan since the 2008 Asia Cup, with bilateral matches confined to ICC events. The last bilateral series was a limited-overs tour in 2012-13 by Pakistan to India. While Pakistan successfully hosted parts of the 2023 Asia Cup, including India’s matches held in Sri Lanka, Naqvi's recent remarks suggest a reluctance to follow a similar path for the Champions Trophy. As of now, the Champions Trophy schedule and ticketing details remain under wraps, and the situation has prompted the PCB to potentially delay a planned schedule announcement event in Lahore. With 100 days to the tournament, clarity on India’s stance and the ICC’s contingency measures is crucial. The ICC, PCB, and BCCI are yet to release official statements, though discussions with these stakeholders are reportedly underway."

India’s total was boosted by a brilliant 107 from 50 balls by Samson but the innings did stall towards the end. Samson smashed 10 sixes and seven fours as he tore into the bowling at the small Kingsmead ground. He rattled along at a strike rate of 214, providing more than half his team’s total.

Despite this, Van Nistelrooy remains hopeful that young talents Rasmus Højlund and Joshua Zirkzee can eventually fill that crucial role. United have scored just nine goals in their first 10 Premier League matches of the 2024/25 season, with only Southampton and Crystal Palace registering fewer. This lack of cutting edge in front of goal was a key issue that contributed to Erik ten Hag's departure as manager last month. Van Nistelrooy, who was known for his clinical finishing during his playing days at Old Trafford, is fully aware that the club must improve its goal-scoring record to compete at the highest level. However, he is optimistic about the potential of Højlund, who has scored twice in 11 appearances so far this season despite an injury-riddled start, and Zirkzee, who has netted just once in 16 games since his move from Bologna. ""We need a certain amount of goals to be successful in the Premier League and in Europe,"" Van Nistelrooy said. ""The best teams in the world have those players, but we have young players who are still developing. The belief is there that they can reach that level."" Manchester United invested over £100 million ($129 million) to sign Højlund and Zirkzee during the past two summer transfer windows, yet the duo has yet to consistently deliver the firepower needed to propel the team forward. In his short tenure as caretaker manager, Van Nistelrooy has led United to victories over Leicester in the League Cup and PAOK in the Europa League. He also held Chelsea to a 1-1 draw in his only Premier League match in charge to date. Van Nistelrooy's time in charge is expected to come to an end soon, as Ruben Amorim is set to take over from Sporting Lisbon next week. Despite his impending departure, the former United striker has expressed a desire to stay on as an assistant manager under Amorim. ""I knew when I came here it was a special occasion, and I want to be part of this journey with the club in an assistant role,"" Van Nistelrooy said. ""I still have ambitions to manage, but I’m happy to continue in my assistant capacity if that’s the direction the club takes."" With a key managerial change imminent, United will look to continue their recovery under Van Nistelrooy's guidance in their next match against Leicester on Sunday, before Amorim takes charge."

Botham and Hughes, who had fierce competition on the field during their Ashes battles, have remained close friends. The Australian fast bowler was quick to assist Botham during the incident, ensuring the England legend's safe return to the boat.

Despite stepping into the large shoes of former manager Jurgen Klopp, Slot has guided the team to an impressive record of 14 wins and one draw from their opening 16 matches across all competitions. As defending Premier League and Champions League title holders, Slot's transition to the helm has been seamless, thanks in part to the solid foundations laid by Klopp. Liverpool’s run has also seen them progress to the quarter-finals of the League Cup, further boosting their confidence and momentum. ""I wouldn’t say I’m shocked,"" Slot commented ahead of Liverpool's upcoming match against Aston Villa. ""I knew the quality of this team, but consistency is key. From the moment I started working with them, I saw the energy they put in every day, and that is why we’ve been able to maintain such a high level."" Liverpool's recent performances have been nothing short of spectacular. Anfield's electrifying atmosphere helped propel the Reds to a thrilling 2-1 comeback victory against Brighton last weekend, putting them two points ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. The momentum carried over into midweek, with Slot's side dismantling Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in the Champions League, further boosting their claim as one of Europe's top teams. Slot, however, remains focused on keeping his players grounded. While he is encouraged by the fans' enthusiasm, he emphasized the importance of staying consistent. ""If the excitement from the fans helps create the atmosphere we had in the second half against Brighton or in the game against Leverkusen, then I hope they stay excited,"" he added. Liverpool will be without Diogo Jota for their upcoming fixture, with the forward expected to return after the international break later this month. As the Reds look to extend their lead at the top of both competitions, Slot will continue to rely on the dedication and energy of his squad as they aim for just their second Premier League title in 35 years."

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) communicated its decision to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and expressed a preference to play all of its matches in Dubai. India's stance remains unchanged despite recent diplomatic talks between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Islamabad. The two nations' first direct high-level conversation since 2015 had sparked hopes of restoring cricketing ties, but the BCCI insists on playing its matches outside Pakistan.  The Champions Trophy, scheduled from February 19 to March 9, 2025, will feature the top eight cricketing nations. Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi are set to host the tournament, but India has remained firm on its position, following consultations with the Indian government.

Despite a challenging run in recent home Tests, Bumrah backed the veteran batter to make a significant impact in Australia, where he has a strong history. Kohli, 36, has struggled in recent outings, managing just 93 runs in three Tests against New Zealand, averaging a mere 15.50. His poor form has been a talking point, especially after a lackluster home season against Bangladesh and New Zealand. However, Bumrah remained positive about Kohli’s preparation and mentality as India gears up for a tough series in Australian conditions. In a press conference ahead of the opening Test in Perth, Bumrah was asked about Kohli’s recent struggles and his readiness to face Australia's formidable bowling attack. Without hesitation, the Indian pacer stood by his senior teammate, emphasizing that one or two bad series do not define a player of Kohli’s caliber. ""I don't have to say anything about Virat Kohli, the batter. He is one of the greats of the game. I don't need to give him any special input. He is the utmost professional. He is one of the leaders. I made my debut under him. He knows what he is doing. One or two series, here and there, can go up and down,"" Bumrah stated, showing his belief in Kohli’s skills and experience. Bumrah went on to highlight Kohli’s current confidence, stressing that the batter is fully prepared and eager to contribute to the team’s success. While the bowler refrained from making predictions, he hinted at a positive outlook after seeing Kohli’s performance in the nets. ""The confidence he has at this moment, I have no doubts about how he has prepared. He is looking to contribute. The signs are ominous, I don’t want to jinx it, but he is looking in very good shape,"" Bumrah added. Kohli’s history in Australia provides further optimism. With 1,352 runs from 13 Tests at an average of 54.08, including six centuries, the Indian batter has proven himself in the bouncy conditions of the Australian pitches. This strong record offers Kohli a solid foundation as he aims to return to form in what promises to be a crucial series. As for the leadership of the Indian team, Bumrah will be leading the side in the absence of regular captain Rohit Sharma, who is staying back in India for the birth of his second child. Rohit is expected to join the squad before the second Test match in Adelaide, where he may also play in the warm-up match against the Prime Minister's XI."

After an astonishing $957 million in transfer expenditures in 2023, spending has dramatically decreased to just $431 million in the latest transfer window. Despite the star power that players like Ronaldo and N'Golo Kante have brought to the league, the number of new signings has been modest this season. The most notable addition is Brentford’s Ivan Toney, who joined Al Ahli, reflecting a shift in priorities within the league. In 2023, the Saudi Pro League ranked as the second-largest spender globally, just behind the English Premier League. However, it has now dropped to sixth place, trailing behind the top five European competitions it aims to rival. Analysts suggest that Saudi officials are reevaluating the commercial returns of their previous expenditures as the country's ambitious economic modernization efforts face budgetary constraints. James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute, remarked, ""They put themselves on the map last year. It's now a question of how do you sustain that?"" Comparisons have been drawn between Saudi Arabia's football project and the former Chinese Super League, which also saw exorbitant spending before experiencing financial setbacks. With Saudi Arabia set to host the 2034 World Cup, the league may still pursue strategic acquisitions, although experts believe the lavish signings of 2023 are unlikely to be a regular occurrence. Simon Chadwick, professor of sport and geopolitical economy at France's SKEMA Business School, noted that there are ""more considered and strategic ways"" to tackle talent acquisition challenges. The decrease in spending aligns with broader economic trends affecting Saudi Arabia’s major infrastructure projects under the Vision 2030 plan, as the government reassesses spending amidst global economic uncertainties. The Public Investment Fund has also taken measures to assess financial viability, including issuing bonds to fund ongoing projects. As football globally experiences a decline in transfer fees—down 13% this summer—analysts note that a ""wind of austerity is blowing through football."" Mohamed Mandour, a journalist at Sportsdata, highlighted that the Saudi Pro League's current strategy reflects a more realistic approach to spending, focusing on attracting sponsors and resources from outside the country. An official from the Saudi Professional League, speaking anonymously, emphasized that the league's spending decisions illustrate its maturity and commitment to improving the technical quality of its teams. ""Who says we have to sign a big player every summer?"" they stated, indicating a shift in focus from marquee signings to sustainable growth."

Neeskens, known for his tenacious midfield play and integral role alongside Johan Cruyff in the Ajax and Netherlands teams, passed away on Sunday following an undisclosed illness. “With Johan Neeskens, the Dutch and international football world loses a legend,” the KNVB said in a statement. The federation paid tribute to Neeskens' contributions both on and off the field, remembering him for his ""characteristic tackles, sublime insight, and iconic penalties.""

He earned 49 caps for his country and left a lasting legacy in football history. Following his illustrious playing career, Neeskens transitioned into coaching and remained active in global football development. Ajax paid tribute on social media, writing, ""We are deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Johan Neeskens. Our thoughts are with his family at this time. Rest in peace, Ajax legend.""

The 32-year-old Aston Villa star, who played a key role in Argentina's recent international successes, was also found guilty of ""violating principles of fair play"" in two separate incidents. The first violation occurred after Argentina's World Cup qualifier win against Chile on September 5, where Martinez was seen holding a replica of the Copa America trophy to his groin. This isn't the first time the goalkeeper has made headlines for such actions, as he previously performed a similar gesture with the Golden Glove trophy after Argentina’s dramatic World Cup final victory against France in 2022.

As a consequence of the suspension, Martinez will miss Argentina’s upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against Venezuela on October 10 and Bolivia on October 15. Argentina currently leads the South American qualifying table with 18 points from eight matches, with Colombia trailing just two points behind.

Under new manager Enzo Maresca, the Blues have managed just one win in their first three Premier League games, raising concerns about their form despite an extensive and expensive summer rebuild. Chelsea took the lead in the 25th minute when Nicolas Jackson finished a well-constructed move initiated by Noni Madueke and Cole Palmer. However, Palace struck back early in the second half through a spectacular curling effort from Eberechi Eze, who beat Chelsea's goalkeeper Robert Sanchez from 20 yards. The match was marked by controversy as Maresca was left fuming after Palace midfielder Will Hughes escaped a second yellow card for a foul on Palmer. Despite creating chances, including a late miss by Jackson, Chelsea failed to secure a win, leaving them with just four points from their opening three games. Newcastle, meanwhile, claimed a 2-1 victory over Tottenham at St James' Park. The Magpies took the lead through a stunning volley by Harvey Barnes in the 37th minute. Tottenham equalized in the second half after a Dan Burn own goal, but Newcastle regained the lead with Alexander Isak's tap-in after a brilliant setup by Jacob Murphy.

As he prepares for what is likely his final appearance at Roland Garros, the chances of adding to his record are slim due to his recent struggles with injuries. Nevertheless, Nadal's legacy and reputation in the sport remain unmatched. Nadal, who has won 22 Grand Slam titles in total, first triumphed at Roland Garros as a teenager in 2005. This year, as he celebrates his 38th birthday, he finds himself ranked 276th in the world, having played only 15 matches since January last year. His career has been marred by numerous injuries, including a hip injury and a muscle tear, which have caused him to miss 12 Grand Slam tournaments. Despite these setbacks, Nadal is determined to give it his all at the 2024 French Open. ""I'm going to play the tournament thinking that I can give my all, 100 percent,"" Nadal stated after a second-round exit in Rome last week. ""And if 100 percent is not enough to win a match, I'll accept that. But I don't want to step onto the court, knowing that I have no chance. If there's a 0.01% chance, I want to explore that and give it a go."" Nadal's remarkable record at Roland Garros includes 112 wins and just three losses, two of which were against his long-time rival Novak Djokovic. His popularity and impact on the sport are evident, with around 6,000 fans turning up to watch his first training session on Court Philippe Chatrier, chanting his name throughout. ""We have to enjoy the time he has left on court, evaluate it, and be aware that it's very unlikely that something like this will happen again,"" said Nadal's coach Carlos Moya during the recent Madrid Open. ""He's one of the great stars of this sport, he's about to retire, and it's really amazing to see that."" Nadal is not the only top player facing challenges ahead of the French Open. Novak Djokovic, the defending champion and record 24-time Grand Slam title winner, is also under pressure. Djokovic, who has won three French Open titles, is experiencing a title drought not seen since 2018. This year, he has lost his Australian Open title and has yet to reach a final on tour. In addition to his on-court struggles, Djokovic was involved in a freak accident in Rome where he was hit on the head by a falling water bottle, causing nausea and dizziness. In an effort to regain some form, Djokovic accepted a late wild card entry into the ongoing Geneva tournament. The competition at Roland Garros this year will also feature rising stars dealing with their own challenges. World number two Jannik Sinner, who succeeded Djokovic as the Australian Open champion, is recovering from a hip injury that forced him to skip the Rome Open. Sinner, who reached the quarterfinals at Roland Garros in his debut year in 2020, has a chance to become the world number one if he performs well in Paris. Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning Wimbledon champion and world number three, also skipped Rome due to an arm injury. Last year, Alcaraz took the first set off Djokovic in their semi-final match at Roland Garros before succumbing to body cramps and ultimately losing. The young Spaniard attributed his physical issues to the pressure of facing Djokovic.  "

Khelif, silver medallist at the 2022 World Championships, and Taiwan boxer Lin Yu-ting have been in the spotlight as part of a gender dispute in Paris that has dominated headlines and been the subject of much discussion on social media platforms. Khelif, who won by unanimous decision, is the first Algerian woman to earn an Olympic boxing title and the first boxer from her country to claim gold since Hocine Soltani at Atlanta 1996. Women's boxing has been in the Olympics since London 2012. ""This is my dream. Eight years, my dream. I'm Olympic champion, gold medallist. I'm very happy. Eight years, I work,"" Khelif, 25, said. ""Eight years, no sleep. Eight years, tired. Now I'm Olympic champion. I'm very happy. I want to thank all the people come to support me. People, Algeria, and all the people, Paris. ""This gold medal is the best answer to the fierce campaign against me."" Responding to the controversy surrounding her, Khelif told a press conference: ""I am a woman like any woman. I was born a woman and I have lived as a woman, but there are enemies to success and they can't digest my success."" Her defeated opponent Yang said: ""I'm happy for her. I respect everybody and I will even learn from her (boxing wise)."" Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand and Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin were awarded bronze. Khelif and double world champion Lin were disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) from the 2023 World Championships, with the body saying at a press conference during the Paris Games that a gender test had ruled them ineligible. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is using boxing eligibility rules in Paris that were applied at the 2016 and 2021 Olympics and which do not include gender testing. The volume went up several notches to ear-splitting level when Khelif entered the arena on Friday in her red trunks and shirt for the last bout on a suffocating Parisian evening, the only breeze coming from the hundreds of flags being waved. ""Imane, Imane, Imane!"" the crowd chanted and screamed. Yang was even booed as she made her entrance. Khelif, keeping her opponent at bay with her jab and taking control of the centre of the ring, landed an early left hook, soon followed by a right as she looked in total control. She sent Yang to the ropes with a precise right hook at the start of the second round. Yang refused to back down but never found the right distance to threaten her opponent, who rode a wave of support on court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros. The crowd cheered as Khelif's corner carried her on their shoulders to the end of the stadium. They roared even more when she jumped down and began shadow-boxing towards the stands to the tune of 'Abdelkader', from the cult album ""1,2,3 Soleil"" by three of the most famous French-Algerian singers: Cheb Khaled, Rachid Taha and Faudel. It really had seemed as easy as ABC for Khelif as the Jackson Five song blared out over the speakers while the podium was built on the ring as another moment of celebration awaited. The crowd started ululating, with the joyful high-pitched sound usually performed by women in the Arab world at weddings and celebrations reverberating through the arena before the Algerian anthem Khelif then embraced the other three women on the podium in a scene of sheer joy. Khelif and Lin are competing at the Games after the IOC stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's governing body in 2023 and took control of organising the boxing in Paris. The IOC rejected the results of the IBA-ordered gender tests as arbitrary and illegitimate, saying there was no reason to conduct them - a stance backed on Friday by Human Rights Watch."

This will create a major disturbance for residents of the area. The event will also cause traffic jams. Hence, I have urged the city police commissioner to cancel the programme,"" the BJP leader said in a statement. During his Dil-Luminati India Tour 2024, Diljit Dosanjh addressed growing criticism over alcohol-themed songs in his performances. At his Ahmedabad concert, held in Gujarat, a dry state, Diljit reassured the audience he would not perform songs referencing alcohol. Taking a light-hearted jab, he said, ""There's some good news. I didn't get any notice today. There's more good news: I'll not sing a single song on alcohol today either. Ask me why? Because Gujarat is a dry state."" Earlier, ahead of his Hyderabad concert, the Telangana government had sent him a notice urging him to avoid songs promoting alcohol, drugs, or violence. In response, Diljit adjusted the lyrics of popular tracks like Lemonade and 5 Taara, replacing references to alcohol. The singer also emphasized he is a teetotaller and pledged to stop making songs about alcohol if states declare themselves alcohol-free. ""Let's do something; let's start a movement. If all states declare themselves dry states, I'll stop singing songs on alcohol from the very next day... I will stop singing about alcohol, you shut the 'thekas' in the country... I take a pledge. ""Is this possible? It's a big source of revenue. Everything was shut in corona (pandemic), except the thekas. You can't fool the youth,"" he can be seen saying in a video shared on Diljit's official Instagram page."

As the festive season draws near, the Princess has decided to surprise her admirers by bringing a notable shift to her usual attire for this year’s highly anticipated event. Kate, who is set to host the concert at Westminster Abbey, is expected to wear her iconic sapphire engagement ring, which has become one of her signature pieces of jewelry. The sapphire ring, once belonging to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, has a rich history and is a much-recognized symbol of the royal family. It features a stunning 12-carat oval sapphire, surrounded by 14 diamonds, set in white gold. The deep blue sapphire has long captivated royal watchers and is often seen at high-profile occasions. Jewelry expert James Harris, speaking to GB News, explained that the Princess typically reserves the ring for significant royal events. ""It’s very likely that Kate will wear her engagement ring during the Christmas Carol concert this year, as she often does for public events, especially those with royal significance,"" Harris said. ""Her iconic sapphire ring is almost always visible at high-profile events and was photographed at last year’s concert while she took on hosting duties."" For those unfamiliar, the ring has been a central piece in royal history, having been passed down to Kate by her husband, Prince William. It was originally given to Princess Diana by Prince Charles in 1981, and since then, it has become one of the most famous royal pieces of jewellery. This year’s concert holds additional personal significance for Kate, as it will be her first major public event since her chemotherapy treatments. Her strength and resilience throughout this time have garnered widespread admiration, and her return to hosting duties is seen as a symbol of her commitment to her royal responsibilities."

The arrest followed a theft incident on October 30, where Velez used a fake barcode to scan items at significantly lower prices, resulting in a $500.32 loss for the store. The Cape Coral Police Department (CCPD) reported that Target's loss prevention team noticed discrepancies during checkout and alerted authorities. Security footage showed a woman matching Velez's description — a female aged 20 to 35, with long black hair, wearing tan clothing and glasses. A breakthrough came when an anonymous follower recognized Velez and provided her Instagram handle to the police. Investigators soon found her TikTok account, where she had posted a video on the same day, wearing the exact outfit captured in the store's surveillance footage. ""She essentially incriminated herself,"" said Officer Riley Carter from the CCPD. ""Social media gave us an unexpected lead, which expedited her identification and subsequent arrest."" Velez has been charged with petty theft, a crime involving an item valued between $100 and $750, and was booked into Lee County jail. This arrest marks a troubling continuation of her criminal history. In 2019, at the age of 17, Velez was arrested for grand theft auto. A former high school friend, Amanda Santana, shared her experience, stating that Velez stole and crashed her car after earning her trust. This was not the first time Velez was caught stealing. In July 2023, she was arrested for shoplifting at a Walmart in Cape Coral, where she under-rang items worth $63 at a self-checkout. After pleading no contest to the charges in April 2024, Velez completed an anti-theft course and served six months of probation. Despite her probation ending last month, Velez allegedly committed another theft, which has now escalated her legal issues. “She’s been living recklessly, flaunting a lifestyle that doesn’t match her actions,” Santana commented. The arrest has sparked broader debates about social media influencers and their accountability. Critics argue that influencers often project false personas online, shielding them from the consequences of their actions. “Influencers should face the same consequences as anyone else,” Officer Carter emphasized. ""Their public image doesn’t exempt them from the law."""

The film, produced by Mano Animation Studios, is vying for recognition in two prestigious categories: Best Animated Feature and Best International Feature Film. This marks a historic achievement as The Glassworker becomes Pakistan’s first animated film to qualify for consideration at the Oscars. The film is one of 31 entries competing for the Best Animated Feature nod, alongside industry giants such as Pixar’s Inside Out 2, which is already lauded as the highest-grossing animated release of all time, and DreamWorks’ Kung Fu Panda 4. Also in the running are Despicable Me 4 and Japan’s Kensuke’s Kingdom. In the International Feature Film category, The Glassworker is competing with 85 films from around the world, including notable submissions like Laapata Ladies from India, directed by Kiran Rao, and From Ground Zero, an anthology of short films by Palestinian directors exploring the ongoing Gaza conflict. Other entries include Israel’s Come Closer, highlighting the diverse narratives represented in this year’s list. The inclusion of The Glassworker in these two categories not only highlights the growing recognition of Pakistan's creative industries but also signals the country’s potential to make an impact on the global cinematic landscape. Set against the backdrop of South Asian-inspired landscapes, the film follows the story of Vincent, a young glass artisan, and his relationship with Alliz, the daughter of one of his clients. As their bond deepens, the film explores the emotional complexities of growing up and the turbulence of war. The intricate hand-drawn animation and evocative score have earned The Glassworker widespread acclaim, positioning it as a standout contender. Its inclusion on the Academy’s longlist is a testament to the growing influence of Pakistan’s animation sector, which, despite being in its early stages, has already garnered international attention. As the Oscar race intensifies, the road to recognition remains a challenging one. In the Animated Feature category, films undergo rigorous evaluations by members of the Academy’s Animation Branch. In contrast, the International Feature category requires all Academy members to meet specific viewing requirements before casting their votes. The Academy’s shortlists, which will narrow down the contenders, will be announced on December 17, 2024, with the final nominations set to follow on January 23, 2025. For The Glassworker, the journey to the Oscars has already been a momentous achievement, marking a key moment for Pakistan’s film industry on the world stage."

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex initially adopted a “divide and conquer” strategy, tackling individual initiatives to broaden their impact while reinforcing their joint brand.However, recent developments have raised questions about the state of their relationship as Meghan appears to have stepped back from the public spotlight, leaving Harry to champion their causes solo. In the past months, Harry has been at the forefront of numerous engagements, showcasing his dedication to humanitarian causes. Notable appearances include his hosting of a video call with members of Scotty’s Little Soldiers, promoting the Invictus Games, and attending the WellChild Awards. Meanwhile, Meghan’s public activity has been comparatively muted, with her recent attendance at a haircare line launch in Los Angeles drawing limited attention. Observers have also pointed to Meghan’s absence during Harry’s recent solo trip to Canada, a location with sentimental value for the couple, where they once promoted the Invictus Games together. Instead of returning promptly to his wife, Harry extended his stay to spend time with friends and family, prompting further questions about the couple's current dynamic. The contrasting optics have fueled speculation about a potential imbalance in their partnership, with Harry emerging as the primary face of the Sussex brand while Meghan takes a quieter role. Despite the conjecture, neither Harry nor Meghan has addressed the rumors, leaving royal commentators and fans alike to interpret their actions. Whether this shift reflects a deliberate strategy or signals underlying issues remains unclear, but it underscores the evolving nature of their partnership."

Director Vicky Jenson, renowned for co-directing the iconic Shrek, breaks this mold with her new film Spellbound, releasing Friday on Netflix. ""Isn't it funny that you can kill off a parent in films like The Lion King or Bambi, but the idea of parents simply not living together is taboo?"" Jenson remarked. While live-action family classics such as The Parent Trap and Mrs. Doubtfire have approached divorce with humor, animated films have shied away—until now. In Spellbound, a spell transforms a princess’s parents into literal monsters, an allegorical exploration of familial strife. Set in the magical kingdom of Lumbria, the story follows Princess Ellian (voiced by Rachel Zegler), who embarks on a perilous quest to reverse the curse on her parents, Queen Ellsmere (Nicole Kidman) and King Solon (Javier Bardem). As chaos grips the kingdom, Ellian learns a sobering truth: even if the spell is lifted, her family may never return to its former state. ""This was a fairy tale take on a modern story,"" said Jenson, highlighting the film’s contemporary relevance. The creative team collaborated with family psychologists to ensure the narrative resonated authentically with young viewers navigating similar challenges in real life. Getting Spellbound to audiences was no easy feat. According to Jenson, many potential distributors lauded the movie’s message but hesitated to take it on. Eventually, Netflix embraced the project, a move Jenson praised as “brave” in an industry dominated by superhero blockbusters and “safe bets” in theaters. Legendary composer Alan Menken, known for classics like Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid, joined the project to underscore its emotional depth with a magical score. For Jenson, Spellbound represents a new fairy tale that offers families insight and comfort. ""This truth about family life is there for so many of us but hadn’t been approached as a myth or new fairy tale before,"" Jenson noted. With Spellbound, Netflix delivers a heartfelt, boundary-pushing tale, offering children and parents a mirror to navigate the complexities of family life through a magical lens."

Despite the mishap, Dosanjh regained his balance and continued his energetic performance. Pausing the music to address the issue, the singer explained that the pyrotechnics used during the show had caused fuel to spill onto the stage, resulting in the slip.“Bhai yahan pe fire jo chhodte ho, mat chhodo. Tel aata hai yahan. I am okay,” Dosanjh told the audience, urging the organizers to halt the use of such effects to prevent further accidents. This slip brought back memories of a similar incident in the early 2010s when Dosanjh fell during a joint performance with Yo Yo Honey Singh on “Lakk 28.” However, the singer’s resilience shone through as he resumed the concert with the same high energy, keeping the crowd engaged. In addition to addressing the accident, Dosanjh also took the opportunity to discuss a legal matter that had recently surfaced. He revealed that he had received a legal notice before his Hyderabad concert, instructing him to remove references to alcohol and drugs from his songs.While no such notice had been issued for his Ahmedabad performance, Dosanjh took it in stride and altered the lyrics of “Patiala Peg” to avoid any controversy. In his remarks, Dosanjh highlighted his versatility as an artist. “I have sung dozens of devotional songs. In the last 10 days, I released two devotional tracks, but no one talks about them—only ‘Patiala Peg’ makes headlines,” he noted, emphasizing the importance of recognizing his broader musical contributions. Addressing the alcohol-related controversy, Dosanjh proposed a challenge to the authorities: “If all states completely ban liquor, I will never sing about alcohol again. At the very least, declare a dry day on my concert dates, and I will refrain from performing any alcohol-related songs.”"

Speaking candidly, Mathira revealed that the videos, which went viral on social media, were fabricated and edited by a man from Jhang. The individual allegedly sold the manipulated content for an average price of Rs 2,000, leading to its widespread circulation. Mathira stated that she promptly contacted cybercrime authorities, who investigated the matter and identified the culprit. ""The man was not only involved in distributing my videos but was also selling indecent content of other women,"" she said.

But I'll surely be announcing Krrish 4 very soon,” Rakesh stated.

Consumers have labeled the Italian luxury label, renowned for its playful and food-inspired creations - including its £995 French bread leather bag, 'bonkers' for marketing the 'meticulously handcrafted' green accessory for almost £4,000. The distinctive handbag has captured the attention of retailer Aldi, with the budget supermarket choosing to challenge the luxury brand by presenting its shoppers with an economical alternative - priced at 75p. The designer piece, named the 'Sedano Bag', is crafted from nappa leather and is characterized by the brand as a 'maxi celery-shaped clutch with a digital print that has a three-dimensional effect'. The company further noted that its two-tone coloring added 'realism to the accessory' and 'its unique shape represents the symbol of Moschino's irreverent spirit'. The development appears to have motivated Aldi to venture into high fashion, despite their item lacking style and couture, yet abundant in practicality. Poking fun at Moschino, Aldi posted an image on Facebook featuring a model wearing a nude mac coat while holding a bunch of green celery sticks listed at 75p. The text stated: ""Your move Moschino, but we do have a whole veg aisle."" The model is shown wandering through the fruit and veg section while adopting various poses, and in one shot appears before displays of oranges and green apples. The photographs shared notable resemblances with the advertisement on Moschino's website - the sole distinction being the use of an actual celery-shaped bag, and naturally its substantial price tag. Moschino detailed that the leaves and branches on the bag were constructed with a wire core 'to allow their movement and create the desired volume'. The sophisticated accessory also incorporates 'digital print' which references 'the photograph of a real celery'. However customers remain skeptical and have responded to both the expensive bag and Aldi's mockery with incredulity and humor. ""Have Moschino actually lost the plot?"" wrote one person. Another remarked: ""Brilliant as always Aldi! [I] think Moschino have taken leaf of their senses"". Doubting its reality, someone else commented: ""lol I had to look! Didn't believe it! But it's true!"" Meanwhile one individual questioned: ""Who would actually buy a celery bag?"" Elsewhere, a shopper on Reddit quipped: ""Where would you wear these? At the farmers market?"" Another stated: ""I might as well use what's in my fridge and go outside"" and a third declared: ""I think it's rich people cosplaying regular people who do things like buying groceries lol""."

Yes, it's a party, with dinner and cocktails for about 400 guests who have been invited, but it's also a major fundraiser for the Costume Institute at the Met, the only part of the museum that has to pay for itself.

But no one was singing. Theatre troupe Fantasi Tuli (Deaf Fantasy) was performing Indonesia's first musical with mainly deaf artists and crew on Saturday, using screens around the stage showing dialogue and lyrics as actors performed with their facial expressions and hand signs. The musical ""Senandung Senyap"" (Songs of Silence) depicts the plight of students in a middle school for children with disabilities. Directors Hasna Mufidah and Helga Theresia created it to raise awareness and promote the use of sign language. ""My hope is, going forward, inclusivity can be strengthened, that between deaf and hearing people, hearing is not superior - we're equal,"" Mufidah, who is deaf, said through Indonesian sign language. Involving more than 60 deaf actors and crew, aged 16 to 40, the musical took three months to prepare. It is inspired by Deaf West Theatre in the United States, Helga said. The performance examines special-needs education in Indonesian schools, where deaf students are often taught with an emphasis on speech training and lip-reading, more than on sign language, amid a wider debate about the best education methods for children with hearing disability. Some in the deaf community argue oral education can lead to a sense of alienation, and that sign language is a more natural way to communicate for them. Proponents of such a method say it could better integrate people with hearing disability with the more dominant hearing community. For deaf actor Hanna Aretha Oktavia, the musical was her introduction to sign language and the wider deaf community. ""Throughout dialogue rehearsals we had to use as much expressions as possible and to follow the storyline,"" Hanna said. ""What's interesting is in rehearsals we have to feel the tempo and vibrations and match them with the choreography. I think that's the most intriguing part because I love to dance. And we paid close attention to the beats with the help of hearing aids. We use big speakers to help guide us,"" she said. More than 2 million of Indonesia's 280 million people have a hearing disability, including 27,983 students in special-needs schools."

Tributes poured in from the music world and New York’s Empire State Building said it would illuminate the skyscraper in tie-dye colors to honor a member of the psychedelic band known for lengthy improvisations in its live shows, which drew dedicated “Dead Head” fans known for traveling from concert to concert. The Instagram post said he died peacefully, surrounded by family. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Lesh as the 11th greatest bass player of all time, though he also sang lead and backing vocals. Many fans considered him as influential as the band’s front man, Jerry Garcia, who died in 1995. “His idea - ‘play bass and lead at the same time,’ his notes darting in and around the melody - became as recognizable a part of the Dead’s sound as Garcia’s guitar,” Rolling Stone said. “Phil was more than a revolutionary, groundbreaking bass player - he transformed how I thought about music as a teenager,” Trey Anastasio, the lead guitarist of Phish, wrote on Instagram. Formed in California in 1965, the Dead came to prominence during the 1967 Summer of Love in San Francisco, a counterculture movement that embraced peace, love and hallucinogenic drugs. But the Dead’s music endured much longer than that as a mixture of rock, folk, country and jazz. After Garcia’s death, longtime players Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart formed various lineups under the name Dead & Company, while Lesh opted instead to create Phil Lesh and Friends, which played until 2023. Philip Chapman Lesh was born on March 15, 1940, in Berkeley, California, and began playing classical violin before switching to “cool jazz” big-band trumpet, his official Dead biography said. He later studied with experimental Italian composer Luciano Berio before his friend Garcia told him in 1965 that he was the new bass player for the Warlocks, Garcia’s band that was a precursor to the Grateful Dead. Lesh responded, “Why not?” Lesh is survived by his wife, Jill Lesh, and their two sons, Grahame and Brian."

Nusr-Et Steakhouse, located in the upscale Knightsbridge area, saw its earnings plummet in 2022 as the cost-of-living crisis hit its wealthy customers. The restaurant reported a profit of £1.7 million in 2023, down from £3.3 million the previous year, with sales declining by 31%. These financial struggles are fuelling speculation about the future of the restaurant, which has faced numerous negative reviews and criticism for its exorbitantly priced menu. Items like the £630 giant tomahawk steak and £50 gold-plated baklava have garnered attention, with some diners spending thousands on a single meal. The London branch opened in September 2021, riding on the viral fame of Salt Bae, whose real name is Nusret Gökçe. The 41-year-old Turkish chef gained global recognition in 2017 after a video of him theatrically salting a steak went viral, earning him millions of Instagram followers and celebrity patrons such as Leonardo DiCaprio, David Beckham, and Lionel Messi. Despite initial success, with over £8 million in sales during its first three months, the restaurant has struggled to maintain momentum, seeing a steep decline in turnover just three years later. Gökçe's global restaurant empire, which spans 18 locations including Los Angeles, New York, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Mykonos, has also shown signs of instability. His New York steakhouse closed in May 2023, following the earlier closure of his Manhattan burger joint. In the UK, the Knightsbridge venue has been met with relentless criticism, both for its prices and its overall ambiance. On TripAdvisor, Nusr-Et ranks 15,019 out of 15,426 London restaurants, with a dismal rating of 2.5 stars. Many customers have slammed the restaurant, calling the food overpriced and of poor quality. For example, the Golden Giant Tomahawk steak once sold for £1,450, and a Golden Giant Striploin went for £1,350. One unhappy diner described their experience as ""terrible,"" claiming the meat was tasteless and following up their £300 meal with a £5 kebab. Another lamented the ""poor quality"" and ""small portions"" after spending over £1,800 for three people. A third reviewer, who praised Gökçe’s other venues in L.A., Turkey, and Dubai, called the London branch ""the worst one yet."" In response to the backlash, the restaurant introduced a more affordable menu, though prices remain high, with a burger and fries costing £45. Salt Bae's other locations can be even pricier, as demonstrated earlier this year when he shared a receipt from his Dubai restaurant totalling £85,000, with £56,000 spent on wine alone. Before his viral fame, Gökçe was already an established figure in the food world, but it was his Instagram video of preparing an Ottoman steak that truly catapulted his career. The clip, which shows him theatrically sprinkling salt ""like a cobra,"" has garnered over 17 million views. His signature move and fashionable appearance earned him the moniker ""sexiest butcher on Instagram."" However, his attention-seeking antics have also drawn criticism. After making his way onto the pitch during Argentina's World Cup victory celebrations in 2022, where he handled the trophy and bit a winner’s medal, Gökçe faced backlash and a FIFA investigation. Reflecting on the incident, he later vowed never to step onto a World Cup pitch again. Despite this, Salt Bae continues to flaunt his lavish lifestyle, sharing a video of his £36 million Maçka Palace in Istanbul. He also faced criticism for offering a 30% discount on his gold-wrapped steaks to students at his Boston restaurant, where the final price still exceeded $1,000. His Instagram post, in which he posed in front of Harvard Business School, highlighted his appreciation for education despite never attending university himself. Social media users pointed out that even with the discount, most students would never be able to afford such an extravagant meal."

Excessive meat intake can lead to conditions such as diarrhea, indigestion, cholera, and other stomach diseases. Nutrition experts recommend that a healthy individual should consume 60 to 100 grams of meat per day. This amount provides approximately 143 calories, 3 to 5 grams of fat, 26 grams of protein, and several essential vitamins and minerals. They also suggest that meat consumption should be limited to twice a week. Also read: Eid-ul-Azha being celebrated with religious fervor across Pakistan Experts highlight that the nutritional composition of meat can vary depending on the type and source, but generally, all meats contain beneficial nutrients like protein, fats, vitamin B12, zinc, vitamin B6, and iron. However, excessive intake of these nutrients can be harmful. A healthy person can safely consume up to half a kilo of meat per week. It is advised not to store sacrificial meat in the freezer for more than 12 weeks, as prolonged storage can be detrimental to health. Medical professionals recommend thoroughly cleaning and cooking meat before consumption. Cardiologists caution heart disease patients against eating organs such as the liver and kidneys due to their high cholesterol content. Also read: 6.8 million animals to be sacrificed on Eid-ul-Azha in Pakistan Nutritionists advise using minimal oil in cooking meat during Eid-ul-Azha and incorporating ginger, garlic, turmeric, and garam masala for added health benefits.

Already contending with poor crop management amid the wheat crisis, the agricultural sector now faces additional pressure from these regressive taxes. The imposition of a 20 percent federal excise duty (FED) on fruit juice manufacturers in the latest federal budget has significantly reduced the market for surplus produce and export leftovers. In response, the juice industry has cut back on its fruit pulp purchases, leading pulp manufacturers to scale down their fruit procurement due to lower demand. Traditionally, fruit orchard owners sold their surplus produce and high yields to pulp manufacturers, who then supplied the juice companies, creating a value chain that benefited local growers. Annually, over 100,000 tonnes of fruits like guava, mangoes, apples, oranges, and strawberries are purchased. The local juice beverage industry has been burdened with increasing taxes in recent years. The 2023-2024 budget increased the FED from 5 percent (plus 17 percent sales tax) in 2018-2019 to 20 percent (plus 18 percent sales tax). This results in a total tax impact of 42 percent, as the sales tax is applied after the 20 percent FED. Fayyaz Chaudhry, who owns 20 acres near Multan and grows two to three varieties of Chaunsa mangoes, most of which are exported, said that while yields are increasing annually, wastage remains a problem due to the perishable nature of mangoes and the lack of proper storage units. ""Most of our produce is exported, but demand fluctuates. During declines, we sell to local pulp producers who then supply juice makers,"" he explained. “We appeal to Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz sahiba to save us from these policies of the federal government,” he said. Policymakers failed to consider the combined impact of increased taxation, a more than 50 percent rise in raw material costs, and inflationary pressures on prices. Instead of increasing overall tax revenue, these measures have led to a decreased tax contribution from the beverage sector to the national treasury. Industry officials reported a 41 percent decline in volume following the imposition of the CED, with production halted for over 100 days a year. Prior to the recent FED hike, the fruit juice industry was thriving, with a turnover of approximately Rs60 billion, investments of Rs40 billion, and significant job creation. Consumers benefited from increased competition, which expanded the product range to include healthier, sugar-restricted options. Farmers in Multan are lamenting the impending wastage of surplus mangoes in the upcoming harvest season, as they have been unable to secure arrangements with pulping units that typically book produce in advance."

The curfew, set for a trial in November and to be officially launched in March next year, will limit tourist access to specific areas of Bukchon from 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) to 10 a.m. Fines of up to 100,000 won ($72) will be imposed on violators. ""Who would want to visit?"" said Kwon, the owner of the Asian Cultural Art Museum, who moved to the historic area 18 years ago. ""They'll leave with a bad impression of South Korea."" Bukchon Hanok Village, with its narrow winding alleyways in hilly northern Seoul, dates back to the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897). The area has become a popular tourist destination, especially after being featured on a TV show a decade ago. Tourists and Koreans alike are drawn to the neighbourhood for its quaint houses with signature wood columns and doors, a courtyard and tiled roof. However, increased tourism has become more than an inconvenience for the residents, who complain about noise, littering, public urination and invasion of privacy. Some tourists have been caught on surveillance cameras trying to enter private homes or peeking inside without permission, generating friction with locals. Many residents have chosen to leave, leading to a 27.6% drop in the village's population over the past 10 years, according to the Jongno district office. The area attracted approximately 6 million visitors last year, compared with its resident population of around 6,100. Chung Moon-hun, the Jongno district head, says the goal is to protect the rights of residents and the restrictions will be adjusted if necessary to make it effective. The area where curfew hours and fines will be imposed is approximately 34,000 square metres, about the size of five soccer fields. But residents are sceptical about the policy's effectiveness citing loopholes such as exemptions for tourists staying overnight in hanok accommodations. They also blame the proliferation of corporate-run hanok stays for disrupting their lives. Since 2020, authorities have loosened restrictions on traditional Korean houses offering accommodation, resulting in a surge in corporate-run hanok stays in the residential areas, residents say. In 2010, 10 traditional houses were registered in Bukchon under the name Traditional Korean Housing Experience Businesses; by October 2024, that number had ballooned to 116, according to the district office. ""People come for just a day to enjoy themselves, and the noise from parties is extremely loud,"" said Kim Eun-mee, who lives next to a hanok stay. Clearing trash in front of her home has become a chore she has to tend to several times a day. ""It's often difficult to maintain a normal daily routine due to disturbances like people dragging suitcases around even during the early hours, which frequently wakes me up."" Lee Dong-woo, CEO of hanok stay booking platform BUTLER.LEE, said the business took off when owners who found it difficult to renovate or maintain old houses entrusted the property to hospitality businesses. ""These requests are driving the expansion, not because we are actively evicting current residents to operate hanok stays, which is completely untrue,"" Lee who manages 17 hanok stays in Bukchon said. Tourists, meanwhile, are divided over the curfew. Some agree the residents' quality of life is important. Others chafe at the idea of getting fined for simply walking down a public street. There are also questions about enforcement; how to tell tourists from residents, how to make foreigners pay the fine, and the language barrier."

Both visas cater to skilled workers but differ in terms of sponsorship, duration, and application process. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know before making your move. The standard work visa is the most common option for those employed by mainland or free zone companies in the UAE. This visa is typically valid for two to three years, and the entire application process is managed by your employer. Importantly, you won’t need to cover the costs, as it’s the employer’s responsibility. To process the visa, you’ll need to provide the following documents to your employer: Additionally, if you are a physician, pharmacist, nurse, or teacher, you may be required to get a letter of approval from the relevant UAE authorities. Your qualifications should align with the company’s activities. If you’re hired from outside the UAE, you will first receive an entry permit, valid for two months, which allows you to enter the country while your employer processes the work visa. Upon arrival, you’ll need to undergo a medical fitness test and provide biometric data, such as your fingerprints and eye scan, for the Emirates ID. The Emirates ID is a mandatory identification card for all UAE residents. After receiving your work visa and Emirates ID, you can apply for visas for your family members. The Green Visa is a self-sponsored visa, offering more flexibility compared to the standard work visa. Valid for five years, this visa allows you to change jobs without needing employer sponsorship. However, you’ll need to bear the costs and manage the application process on your own. The key advantage of the Green Visa is the extended validity and flexibility to switch jobs. With this visa, you also have the freedom to sponsor your family members for a longer period. Your choice depends on your employment situation. If you have a job offer with a company, the standard work visa, handled entirely by the employer, may be the most straightforward option.

This move aims to streamline taxation and generate additional revenue from outbound labour migration. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has issued a notification outlining the details of this new policy. According to the notification, under clause (b) of serial number 3 of the first schedule of the Federal Excise Act, 2005, a fixed tax of Rs 5,000 will be levied on air tickets for Pakistanis traveling to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries on labour visas. To ensure proper implementation, the labour visa must be visibly printed on the worker’s passport and authenticated by the Protector of Emigrants, part of the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment. This stipulation is intended to confirm the worker's status and eligibility for the tax. The FBR’s decision to impose this tax highlights the government’s effort to regulate and benefit from the significant number of Pakistani workers who travel to the Gulf region for employment opportunities. The fixed excise duty will be applied per ticket for all international flights from Pakistan to GCC countries, specifically for those traveling on labor visas."

The activists threw tomato soup at the ""Sunflowers"" owned by the London Gallery – the painting targeted two years ago – and another from the series that is on loan from Philadelphia Museum of Art for a temporary exhibition. The National Gallery said three people had been arrested and the paintings were unharmed. The stunt came just a few hours after Phoebe Plummer, 23, and Anna Holland, 22, were sentenced for throwing tins of tomato soup on the London-based artwork in October 2022, before gluing themselves to the wall below the painting. The soup caused up to 10,000 pounds ($13,385) worth of damage to the frame in 2022, prosecutors said, though the painting – which was behind a protective screen – was unharmed and went back on display later the same day. Plummer and Holland pleaded not guilty but were convicted after a trial at London's Southwark Crown Court, where Plummer was sentenced to two years in prison for the criminal damage charge. Holland was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Judge Christopher Hehir told Plummer and Holland: ""You two simply had no right to do what you did to 'Sunflowers', and your arrogance in thinking otherwise deserves the strongest condemnation."" Plummer said she took part in the protests knowing she could be arrested and jailed, saying she was being made a political prisoner, which the judge said was ludicrous and self-indulgent. ""It is offensive to the many people in other parts of the world who are suffering persecution, imprisonment and sometimes death for their beliefs,"" Hehir said. Plummer was also sentenced to an additional three months in prison on Friday, having been separately convicted of the relatively new offence of interfering with the use of key national infrastructure. Friday's sentencing comes amid a wider crackdown on protest movements in Britain and across Europe. Activists from Just Stop Oil have staged a number of eye-catching protests in recent years and five members of the group were jailed in July for at least four years for a conspiracy to block London's M25 motorway, in the longest sentences ever imposed for a non-violent protest in Britain."

This coming-of-age story unfolds in the 1950s when Marianne is introduced as a 15-year-old attending country house parties in Berkshire. The upper-middle-class setting is meticulously crafted, evoking the atmosphere of the era with scenes of girls dancing to Tommy Steele, enjoying cider cups, and savouring ""cold collations"" of chicken legs and coleslaw. It's at one of these gatherings that Marianne meets Simon, an 18-year-old Marlborough school student, and experiences the loss of her virginity in the back seat of his baby-blue Morris Minor. Tremain's storytelling combines authenticity with wit, offering humorous moments like Marianne's father, an ex-army colonel, sceptically questioning Simon about his car's performance. The novel delves into the fervent intensity of adolescent love, depicting Marianne's obsessive feelings, from the ""intoxicating"" scent of post-coital knickers to her inability to eat or concentrate. Tremain portrays the chaotic nature of young love vividly. As Marianne matures, she navigates the complexities of life in 1960s London, finding herself in a lonely and miserable state, pining for Simon. Her skin erupts, and she's surrounded by a city that doesn't match the swinging reputation of the era. Marianne's journey includes encounters with various characters, some less than pleasant, as she grapples with her own identity and desires. The story also explores her friendship with Pet, a warm and funny Scottish girl who represents a stark contrast to Marianne's directionless existence. Pet's pursuit of a feminist awakening and a life with purpose stands in contrast to Marianne's caged-up domesticity. The narrative shifts more than a decade later, when Marianne has weathered personal challenges and finds herself stuck in a marriage with Hugo. She reflects on her transformation, realizing she's becoming like her distant and cold mother, Lavender. Marianne's relationship with her parents, especially her brandy-quaffing father, is depicted with nuance and empathy, highlighting their old-fashioned Englishness and co-dependence. ""Absolutely & Forever"" is a character-driven novel that presents Marianne as both frustrating and endearing. Her evolution from immaturity to a more complex individual is portrayed with subtlety and care. Tremain explores themes of tolerance, kindness, and self-realization, making the novel relevant to contemporary readers. The story reminds us that it's possible to break free from constraints without condemning those who may have played a role in shaping our lives. In its best moments, the novel offers wit, thoughtfulness, and a humane perspective, delivering a delicate and contemplative reading experience."
"859","Entertainment","Czech novelist Milan Kundera dies at 94","https://www.samaa.tv/20873165-czech-novelist-milan-kundera-dies-at-94","Milan Kundera, the author of “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” whose dark, provocative novels delved into the enigma of the human condition, has died, a spokeswoman for the Milan Kundera Library in his native city of Brno said on Wednesday. He was 94. “Unfortunately I can confirm that Mr Milan Kundera passed away yesterday (Tuesday) after a prolonged illness,” she told AFP. Through his characteristic satire and poetic prose Kundera had sought to express all that is compelling and absurd about life, drawing on his own experiences of being stripped of his Czech nationality for dissent. Life, he said in his work of criticism “Art of the Novel” (1986), “is a trap we’ve always known: we are born without having asked to be, locked in a body we never chose, and destined to die.” Young rebel Kundera was born on April 1, 1929, in the town of Brno, in what was then Czechoslovakia. His father was a famous pianist. He studied in Prague, where he joined the Communist Party, translated the French poet Apollinaire and wrote poetry of his own. He also taught at a film school where his students included the future Oscar-winning director Milos Forman. Although he professed faithfulness to communism, the independent spirit of Kundera’s writing soon got him into trouble. He was expelled from the party in 1950, re-joined in 1956 and was expelled a second time in 1970 after the Prague Spring reform movement – in which he was seen as playing a role – was crushed. Locked out Kundera’s first novel “The Joke”, a work of dark humour about the one-party state published in 1967, led to a ban on his writing in Czechoslovakia while also making him famous in his homeland. In 1975, he and his wife Vera went into exile in France, where he worked for four years as an assistant professor at the University of Rennes. They were stripped of their Czech nationality in 1979. In his adopted home, where he became a citizen in 1981, his reputation and success grew as translations of his novels appeared, such as “Life is Elsewhere” (1973) set in Czechoslovakia about a poet entrapped by the Communist regime. “The Book of Laughter and Forgetting” (1979) playfully explored through seven interlinked narratives the nature of forgetting in politics, history and daily life. The novel was “brilliant and original,” said the New York Times in 1980, “written with a purity and wit that invite us directly in; it is also strange, with a strangeness that locks us out.” Kundera was an author “fascinated by sex, and prone to sudden, if graceful, skips into autobiography, abstract rumination, and recent Czech history,” said the Times reviewer, John Updike. By far his most famous work, “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” was published in 1984 and turned into a film starring Juliette Binoche and Daniel Day-Lewis in 1987. The novel is a morality tale about freedom and passion, on both an individual and collective level, set against the Prague Spring and its aftermath in exile. No going back? Kundera’s critics say he turned his back on fellow Czechs and dissidents following his exile in France. In 2008, a Czech magazine accused him of being a police informer under Communist rule, which he denied as “pure lies”. In 2013, Kundera published his first novel after a 13-year hiatus. “The Festival of Insignificance”, about five friends in Paris, received mixed reviews, with The Atlantic noting its “near-impenetrable irony” and The Guardian deeming it a “stinker”. What Kundera “has to tell us seems to have less relevance”, said the New York Times. “You can’t help wondering what his evolution would have been like if he had stayed, or stayed longer, in Czechoslovakia.” In 2019, the Czech Republic restored his nationality and in 2023 the Milan Kundera Library opened in his hometown of Brno."

His comments came after the Telangana government banned such songs during his recent concert in Hyderabad. At his Ahmedabad concert, Dosanjh said, ""The good news is that today I have not received any notice. I will not sing songs promoting alcohol here because alcohol is banned in Gujarat."" Dosanjh openly criticized the Telangana government, stating, ""You cannot fool people like this. During the pandemic lockdown, everything was closed except liquor shops. If governments truly care, let them shut down liquor shops across the country. If that happens, I will stop singing songs about alcohol.""

He pointed out the hypocrisy of targeting his music while Bollywood actors openly promote alcohol in advertisements. ""I don’t even drink, yet my songs are under scrutiny, while Bollywood thrives on promoting alcohol culture,"" he said. The controversy escalated after Dosanjh remarked that international artists are given freedom to perform as they wish in India, but local artists face undue restrictions. He suggested his success might be a reason for such criticism. Despite the ban, Dosanjh remained optimistic, saying, ""It is very easy to tweak songs. I have sung dozens of good songs, but people are only talking about ‘Patiala Peg.’ I will adapt, and people will still love my music."" The debate has reignited discussions about censorship, cultural norms, and the double standards applied to Indian artists compared to international performers.

Alleged scheme to influence witnesses exposed","https://www.samaa.tv/2087324204-diddy-s-jail-break-for-justice-alleged-scheme-to-influence-witnesses-exposed","Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has been accused of breaching prison regulations by allegedly contacting potential witnesses in his upcoming sex trafficking trial. Prosecutors have claimed that Mr. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, made “relentless efforts” to influence testimonies through indirect and unauthorised communications. According to court filings, the 55-year-old musician allegedly used other inmates’ phone accounts and engaged in three-way calls to connect with individuals not on his approved contact list. Prosecutors also claimed that he instructed his family to contact witnesses and cited instances of orchestrating social media posts to influence a potential jury. Mr. Combs, known for his 1990s hits I’ll Be Missing You and Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems, has been held in custody in Manhattan since his arrest in September. Multiple bail requests, including a recent $50 million package with 24/7 monitoring, have been denied, with judges citing risks of witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Allegations of witness influence Prosecutors argued that recorded calls and messages reveal Mr. Combs’ alleged attempts to manipulate witnesses. One cited instance involved a social media statement by an unnamed woman, referred to as “witness two,” which prosecutors claim was drafted with Mr. Combs’ input during prison calls. They further alleged that Mr. Combs arranged payment for her after the statement’s release and monitored audience engagement on social media posts to strategize their influence on a potential jury. A video posted by Mr. Combs’ children on November 5, showing them wishing him a happy birthday during a prison call, was also cited as part of this alleged strategy. Mr. Combs’ legal team has pushed back, citing harsh jail conditions that hinder his ability to prepare for trial. Lawyer Alexandra Shapiro highlighted issues such as frequent lockdowns and restricted access to materials, arguing that the lack of a laptop computer and confiscation of note-taking tools violate Mr. Combs’ constitutional rights. However, prosecutors dismissed these concerns, maintaining that detention conditions are standard and insisting that granting bail would pose significant risks to the trial. Criminal and civil cases mount Mr. Combs faces three federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering tied to allegations of orchestrating drug-fuelled, sexually exploitative events. Simultaneously, he is defending against over two dozen civil suits accusing him of sexual assault and exploitation. The accusations began last November when his ex-partner, Cassandra “Cassie” Ventura, filed a civil suit alleging years of abuse. While the case was swiftly settled out of court, it prompted a federal investigation that led to his arrest. Separate lawsuit targets attorney In a separate legal development, a high-profile individual has filed a lawsuit against Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, who represents multiple plaintiffs against Mr. Combs. The lawsuit accuses Mr. Buzbee of extortion, claiming he fabricated allegations to coerce settlements. Responding to the claims, Mr. Buzbee called the lawsuit a “frivolous” attempt to silence him and dismissed allegations of wrongdoing. As Mr. Combs’ trial looms, both legal teams remain entrenched in a battle that could have significant implications for the music icon’s legacy."

In an interview, Rakesh disclosed that Ajay Devgn was initially considered for the role alongside Shah Rukh Khan, not Salman Khan. Rakesh shared that when he first conceptualized 'Karan Arjun', he approached Shah Rukh Khan, who had previously worked with him in the 1993 film 'King Uncle'. Interestingly, Rakesh Roshan was the first producer to pay Shah Rukh Khan, as his debut film 'Deewana' (1992) was still incomplete at the time. Rakesh also cast Ajay Devgn, with whom he had a long-standing connection through Ajay's father, action choreographer Veeru Devgn. Recalling the initial discussions, Rakesh said, “They both came to me – Shah Rukh and Ajay. They said, ‘Sir, we want to talk to you. We want to interchange our image. My (Shah Rukh's) image is romantic, his (Ajay's) image is of an action hero. I want to do action, and he'd do romantic.' I asked them how that would benefit the film. They got thinking. I said if it works in the film's favour, then only I'd do it no. 'If I do it, the film wouldn't work. I'm keeping in mind your image. I'd give him romance, and I'd also give you action to do. They both do action and romance. I'm making a wholesome film so you don't worry about that.' But they weren't convinced,” said Rakesh in Hindi.” When the initial pairing didn’t work out, Rakesh approached Salman Khan and Aamir Khan, fresh off their success in the 1994 cult classic 'Andaz Apna Apna'. However, Shah Rukh later returned. ""Then Shah Rukh came back to me. He said, ‘No no, let me do it. You gave me my break. I'm getting sleepless nights that I'm not doing the film.' So I told Aamir that now I have Shah Rukh's dates,” Rakesh revealed. 'Karan Arjun', produced by Filmkraft Productions, stars Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan in the titular roles, alongside Kajol, Mamta Kulkarni, Raakhee, Amrish Puri, Johnny Lever, and Ranjit. The film remains a cult classic and a hallmark of Bollywood's reincarnation genre."

The intergenerational showdown has all the makings of a crossover hit, with 58-year-old Tyson bringing in the old guard and 27-year-old Paul, who achieved early fame on YouTube, appealing to the younger, screen-toting social media junkies. Available to all of Netflix's more than 280 million subscribers for no additional fee, it could be a welcome change for American boxing fans accustomed to shelling out extra to watch marquee matches on long-time broadcaster HBO. ""The trend in all sports right now is moving some of their properties to streaming,"" said Bob Dorfman, a veteran San Francisco-based sports marketing analyst. ""This is two huge personalities - it does have the potential to be the biggest streaming sports event."" The American subscription television network HBO announced in 2018 it was dropping live boxing from its programming, ending a 45-year relationship with the sport and leaving a broadcasting vacuum in its wake. Netflix has dabbled in sports content before, with exhibition golf and tennis events and the wildly popular docuseries ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"" which is credited with boosting the auto racing circuit's popularity in the U.S. The fight at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, its first live boxing event, works in favour of Netflix's strategy of providing proprietary content that viewers cannot find elsewhere. While the fight will not have traditional advertising, it has sponsors whose messages will be part of the live-streamed event. Advertising is not a major contributor to the streamer's current revenue, though its ad-supported tier is quickly growing, with 70 million subscribers reported this week, up from 40 million in May. The mega-event is the sign of a lasting love affair between sport and streaming, said Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports, though he predicts streaming, and traditional broadcast will exist side-by-side for the foreseeable future. ""This is a one-time-only event... It's more as a novelty in my view. It doesn't change the industry,"" said Pilson, president of Pilson Communications. ""The industry is still going to be driven by the league deals (like) MLS, NFL, Major League Baseball."" Amazon Prime picked up Thursday Night Football in 2021 and MLS signed a 10-year mega-deal with Apple TV in 2022 worth a reported $2.5 billion. Major League Baseball signed a deal with Apple for ""Friday Night Baseball,"" a weekly doubleheader, in 2022, as well. Leagues have been gravitating to streaming both because it reaches a global audience, including younger viewers, who are not watching traditional television. MLS Commissioner Don Garber said the Apple streaming platform allows MLS to better take advantage of the sport's global fanbase. ""We were seeing the difficulty of getting an audience and getting the economics right with local and regional television - we saw that in 2018,"" Garber said this week at the Paley International Council Summit. ""We wanted to go to the market with a global package... We have a subscription that's global, every one of our 600 games is treated like 'Monday Night Football'."""

Kate marked her return to royal responsibilities by attending the solemn Remembrance Sunday services earlier this month, a poignant occasion that symbolized her commitment to her royal role despite the toll on her health. Additionally, the Princess is preparing for her annual Christmas carol concert, which she is personally organizing. However, behind these events lies a mounting pressure that is beginning to affect her well-being. A source close to the royal family disclosed to InTouch Weekly that the strain of balancing her recovery with increasing royal responsibilities is taking a noticeable toll on Kate. “Kate was just trying to concentrate on getting back on her feet after her cancer battle,” the insider explained. “So, the strain must be taking a toll.” The setback comes at a time when the royal family faces public scrutiny over financial matters and environmental concerns. A recent documentary revealed the “secret millions” earned by King Charles and Prince William from their private estates, further fuelling public discontent. The documentary highlights the royals' earnings from public-sector establishments, such as NHS hospitals, prisons, and charities, prompting widespread criticism. Adding to the controversy, Prince William’s property holdings have come under fire for failing to adhere to government-imposed environmental restrictions. These revelations have placed additional strain on the royal family’s image, with Palace aides reportedly instructing Kate and William to maintain a positive public image in the wake of the scandals. Despite the challenges, the Princess and her husband, Prince William, are being called upon to shoulder more responsibilities, particularly as their potential ascension to the throne seems increasingly imminent. The couple, already grappling with a challenging year, now faces the reality that they may have to take on the roles of King and Queen sooner than anticipated. “It’s a unique burden that comes with being next in line to the throne,” an insider remarked. “Kate and William have had to step up and prepare for what lies ahead, regardless of the personal toll it takes.” "

King Charles faces major health battle on his 76th birthday","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323992-unbelievable-king-charles-faces-major-health-battle-on-his-76th-birthday","King Charles III celebrates his 76th birthday on Thursday, continuing to serve as Britain’s head of state despite a year marked by health challenges and personal hardships. Still undergoing cancer treatment, the King’s commitment to his royal duties remains unwavering, as he defies the physical toll of his illness, with his son and heir, Prince William, describing this year as “brutal.” The monarch, who paused his official duties in February after a cancer diagnosis, returned to public service at the end of April, resuming his duties with renewed vigour. ""The problem is trying to stop him,"" remarked Queen Camilla, his wife, on multiple occasions, highlighting Charles’s relentless drive. In recent weeks, King Charles and Queen Camilla resumed their international travel, visiting Australia and Samoa for a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. Sources close to the royal couple revealed that the King returned “invigorated” from the 11-day trip, with plans to continue his overseas engagements in the coming year. Having ascended the throne following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in September 2022, King Charles had already made history as the longest-serving heir apparent in British history, having waited 70 years to take the throne. Despite the challenges of his health, he remains committed to fulfilling his constitutional role “throughout the remaining time God grants me,” as he pledged during his accession. This past Sunday, Charles led the nation in a poignant two-minute silence at the Cenotaph memorial in London, a key moment in the national calendar, commemorating British service members who have lost their lives in battle since 1914. The day before, he attended a commemorative concert at the Royal Albert Hall with his son, Prince William, and daughter-in-law, Princess Catherine, who had recently completed chemotherapy for her own cancer treatment. The King’s birthday will be marked by ceremonial gun salutes, a long-standing royal tradition. However, he will not have the day off; instead, he is set to attend the opening of a food redistribution centre in south London, which is part of his “Coronation Food Project” aimed at tackling food waste and supporting vulnerable communities. This initiative, launched on his 75th birthday, is close to his heart, and he will inspect a newly installed industrial freezer at the facility. It has been a particularly testing year for the royal family. King Charles’s relationship with his younger son, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan remains distant, while both Charles’s and Prince William’s financial matters were the subject of controversy following recent allegations aired in a documentary. Additionally, discussions about reparations for Britain’s colonial past gained traction during the Commonwealth summit earlier this year. However, it is the health issues within the family that have dominated headlines. Following his prostate operation, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the King had been diagnosed with cancer, though the specific type has yet to be disclosed. His wife, Queen Camilla, also experienced health setbacks this year, with a lung infection forcing her to cancel several engagements. In March, Princess Catherine, who is widely admired for her public presence, revealed that she too had been battling cancer, though the details of her diagnosis remain private. After completing her chemotherapy, Catherine shared a heartfelt message on social media in early September, which was met with widespread praise. She has since gradually resumed her royal duties, much to the relief of her supporters. Prince William, speaking candidly earlier this month during a visit to South Africa, acknowledged the emotional strain on the family. ""Honestly, it’s been dreadful. It’s probably been the hardest year in my life,"" he said. ""But from a personal family point of view, it’s been, yeah, it’s been brutal."" The royal family’s health remains under close scrutiny, and recent trips have been carefully managed to ensure their well-being. A doctor accompanied the King and Queen on their trip to Australia and Samoa, and on their return journey, they spent several days at a wellness retreat in India. However, the King was forced to cancel his planned trip to Baku, Azerbaijan, for the COP29 climate summit due to health concerns."

The much-anticipated return, teased in a new promo for The Great Indian Kapil Show, has already created a buzz among fans. Sidhu’s reunion with Kapil Sharma comes after a controversial exit in 2019, and his appearance on the show has sparked mixed reactions, particularly from his replacement, Archana Puran Singh. The promo reveals Sidhu seated in the iconic judge’s chair, a position he once occupied for years, while Archana Puran Singh looks visibly taken aback. In a playful exchange, Kapil Sharma jokes that Archana’s new makeover has turned her into Sidhu, but the former cricketer quickly clears the confusion, asserting that it is indeed him sitting in the chair. Archana, caught off guard, humorously demands that Kapil intervene, asking him to tell Sidhu to vacate her seat. A post shared by Navjot Singh Sidhu (@navjotsinghsidhu)  “Kapil, tell Sardar Sahab to get off my seat. He’s taken over my spot,” she says in the promo, to which Harbhajan Singh, also appearing in the episode, sides with Sidhu, claiming no one can ever replace the original judge. Despite the dramatic promo, the show’s producers have confirmed that Sidhu will not be reclaiming his position as the permanent judge. Instead, he will appear as a guest along with his wife, Navjot Kaur, while cricketer Harbhajan Singh and actress Geeta Basra will also join the fun. The episode promises plenty of laughs as Sunil Grover takes on the role of impersonating Sidhu, recreating his trademark style. Sidhu’s return to the show marks a significant moment, as he had been absent since 2019, following the fallout over his controversial remarks regarding the Pulwama terror attack. In the aftermath of the attack, Sidhu’s comments that terrorism should not be attributed to an entire nation sparked outrage across India, leading to widespread calls for his removal from The Kapil Sharma Show. As tensions simmered, the channel decided to replace Sidhu with Archana Puran Singh, who has since become a beloved presence on the show. At the time, Sidhu defended his statements, claiming he had been absent due to a legislative session and had no prior intimation of his removal from the show. ""If it is regarding my statement, I will stick to what I have been saying yesterday, today, and ever tomorrow,"" he wrote on social media. The new episode, featuring Sidhu’s highly anticipated return, promises to be a delightful mix of nostalgia and humor. Fans of the show are eager to see the former judge back in action, even if only for a brief appearance. As the show continues to captivate audiences, the question on everyone’s mind remains: will Sidhu ever return to the judge’s chair permanently, or will Archana Puran Singh continue to rule in his absence?

In an interview, Rakesh disclosed that Ajay Devgn was initially considered for the role alongside Shah Rukh Khan, not Salman Khan. Rakesh shared that when he first conceptualized 'Karan Arjun', he approached Shah Rukh Khan, who had previously worked with him in the 1993 film 'King Uncle'. Interestingly, Rakesh Roshan was the first producer to pay Shah Rukh Khan, as his debut film 'Deewana' (1992) was still incomplete at the time. Rakesh also cast Ajay Devgn, with whom he had a long-standing connection through Ajay's father, action choreographer Veeru Devgn. Recalling the initial discussions, Rakesh said, “They both came to me – Shah Rukh and Ajay. They said, ‘Sir, we want to talk to you. We want to interchange our image. My (Shah Rukh's) image is romantic, his (Ajay's) image is of an action hero. I want to do action, and he'd do romantic.' I asked them how that would benefit the film. They got thinking. I said if it works in the film's favour, then only I'd do it no. 'If I do it, the film wouldn't work. I'm keeping in mind your image. I'd give him romance, and I'd also give you action to do. They both do action and romance. I'm making a wholesome film so you don't worry about that.' But they weren't convinced,” said Rakesh in Hindi.” When the initial pairing didn’t work out, Rakesh approached Salman Khan and Aamir Khan, fresh off their success in the 1994 cult classic 'Andaz Apna Apna'. However, Shah Rukh later returned. ""Then Shah Rukh came back to me. He said, ‘No no, let me do it. You gave me my break. I'm getting sleepless nights that I'm not doing the film.' So I told Aamir that now I have Shah Rukh's dates,” Rakesh revealed. 'Karan Arjun', produced by Filmkraft Productions, stars Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan in the titular roles, alongside Kajol, Mamta Kulkarni, Raakhee, Amrish Puri, Johnny Lever, and Ranjit. The film remains a cult classic and a hallmark of Bollywood's reincarnation genre."

Ranjha and entrepreneur Malik Asad launched the first Pakistani couture brand in London's Regent Street, marking a significant debut on the global fashion scene. The first ever of its kind project has been brought to Mortimer Street, just off Regent Street, by the creative director Mohsin Naveed Ranjha, managing director Abubakar Naveed Ranjha and fashion ecosystem pioneer Asad Malik. They said their MNR studio is set to redefine luxury and elegance – offering a wide range for both men and women. Mohsin Naveed Ranjha and Malik Asad, speaking at the event, shared that their choice to open in London followed thorough market research. They were convinced that London, especially the Regent Street, Oxford Circus, and Bond Street area, offered the perfect setting for their studio. Their goal is to cater to the British Asian community in the UK while also expanding the reach of Pakistani fashion to a broader audience. Lots of their clients are from India, including a large number of western-based Indian Punjabis, and Bangladesh and London would be the most suitable places. Bollywood actress Sonam Bajwa and dozens of leading Pakistani and Indian society figures attended the opulent launch which had hundreds of people queuing outside the studio to see the glamour on display inside the newly unveiled studio – showcasing richly-made, colourful designer clothes. Cresset CEO Malik Asad said the London launch was based on market research. “It’s all about credibility and good intentions.

Mohsin is in huge demand in India and overseas. Mohsin's journey is so much more than fashion. It is a representation of culture and community which inspires and uplifts. His presence in London symbolizes the global recognition of South Asian creativity and craftsmanship. I have known Mohsin since 2018 and I have been wearing his clothes ever since. I plan to visit Pakistan in the near future."" Mohsin Naveed Ranjha said he wanted to come for a long time to the London hub to show Pakistani craft to the world. “Digital media has ended boundaries and our followers and clients have been asking us to come to London. Latest collections form Lahore, Karachi and Gujranawla and other cities will be available here and there will also be London exclusive collections at this store. We want more Pakistani designs to come to London. This is Pakistan’s soft image on display. Sikh brides from India and elsewhere have been messaging us and they have played a big role in our London launch,” said the creative director. Mohsin Naveed Ranjha said he was full of sentiments of pride and accomplishment. He commented. ""To showcase the unparalleled talent and craftsmanship of our artisans, in the backdrop of one of the world’s most eligible fashion capitals, is a dream realized. My designs pay homage to the vibrant legacy and essence of the South Asian subcontinent, transcending boundaries to unveil its inherent beauty.

For formal events, there's a vintage-inspired tone, adding a timeless quality to her looks. Notably, Kate's pantsuits, a staple of her working wardrobe, have been showcased in various colorways from designers like Alexander McQueen.

Payne, 31, who shot to global fame with the boy band, was found dead after he fell from a third-floor hotel room balcony in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, triggering an outpouring of fan tributes. In the first official details of the autopsy, the prosecutors office said coroners had found 25 injuries compatible with those caused by a fall from height, including fatal head injuries, with internal and external bleeding. It added that there were no signs of a third party being involved, though the incident was being investigated as a ""suspicious death"" out of protocol. ""Everything indicates that the musician was alone when the fall occurred, and was going through some kind of episode due to substance abuse,"" the prosecutors office said. ""City police who surveyed the scene found substances inside the room that at first glance - and pending confirmation from the experts - would be narcotics and alcoholic beverages, as well as several destroyed objects and furniture,"" it added. Police earlier said in a statement they had found the room in ""total disorder"" in a search after his death, with various things smashed and medications scattered around. While details surrounding his death remain unclear, Payne had spoken publicly about his struggles with mental health and using alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame. The city police said that in the atrium of the hotel where Payne had fallen they had found a bottle of whiskey, a lighter and a cellphone. They said they had collected fingerprints from those. In the room of the luxury hotel in the city's trendy Palermo district, police said they found over-the-counter medications, energy packs and anxiety drug Clonazepam. ""Upon entering, total disorder was observed, with various elements broken,"" the police said in a statement, adding they had taken more fingerprints and other evidence to be analysed in labs, as well as a notebook and passport.

And, well, we need you to send someone, please,"" the hotel worker told police in the 911 call. ""We need you to send someone urgently because, well, I don't know if the guest's life is at risk. He is in a room with a balcony. And, well, we are a little afraid that he will do something that will put his life at risk.""

Richard filed the suit on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, also suing former Bad Boy Entertainment CEO Harve Pierre. The legal action by Richard was filed one day after a Michigan prison inmate was awarded a $100 million judgment against the rapper, a judgment Combs' attorney said he would seek to have dismissed. The inmate, Derrick Lee Smith, had accused Combs of drugging and sexually assaulting him at a party almost 30 years ago. Richard belonged to girl group Danity Kane and R&B trio Diddy Dirty Money, which included Combs and singer Kalenna Harper. The groups were part of Bad Boy Records. Combs' attorney, Erica Wolff, said in a statement on Tuesday that the rapper is eager to prove Richard's claims are false in the courtroom. ""Mr. Combs is shocked and disappointed by this lawsuit. In an attempt to rewrite history, Dawn Richard has now manufactured a series of false claims all in the hopes of trying to get a pay day — conveniently timed to coincide with her album release and press tour,"" Wolff wrote. ""If Ms. Richard had such a negative experience with Making the Band and Danity Kane, she would not have chosen to continue working directly with Mr. Combs for Dirty Money, nor would she have returned for the Making the Band reboot in 2020 or agreed to be featured on The Love Album last year,"" she added. During her time working with Combs, Richard alleged in the suit, the rapper repeatedly groped her, was physically violent, and trapped her in a car while threatening her life. Richard met Combs during her audition for his MTV series ""Making the Band"" in 2004, which was when she alleges he began displaying inappropriate behavior. ""(Combs) manipulated her with mantras that submission to his depraved demands was necessary for career advancement, instilling in her the belief that such abuse and exploitation were required for female artists to succeed in the music industry,"" the lawsuit said. In the lawsuit, Richard also said she witnessed Combs abusing his then-girlfriend, the R&B vocalist Cassandra Ventura. Last year, Combs settled a lawsuit filed by Ventura that had accused him of serial physical abuse, sexual slavery and rape. Combs is one of the most influential producers and executives in hip-hop and was a hugely successful performer, as well as the impresario of his own Sean John clothing line."

They've grown from your small takeaway spots to popular dine-in options, with quite a few springing up around town in the recent past. With some confidently marketed as ‘gourmet’, what’s special about them is the focus on the patty: these burgers aren’t your elaborate, layered, dripping with sauces and veggies burgers, but pretty simple, unassuming, and letting the high-quality beef shine like a star. Their patties are juicy, chunky and have a slightly crispy, caramelized crust, while the burgers are usually accompanied by classic toppings such as cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a signature sauce. One of the popular brands serving such burgers is Melt, located in the bustling market of DHA Phase 4. Having relaunched recently, the outlet is more conducive for a takeaway than dine-in considering their limited seating capacity. The interior is quite simple and basic following a yellow and white theme, with a handful of tables set up on the mezzanine floor above the open kitchen. The menu is minimal and fairly basic, with only five selections for beef smash and chicken fillet burgers, as well as a few chicken fillet wraps, crinkle cut fries, shakes, and ice cream. We recently paid a visit to the restaurant to try their 'premium' smash burger. We began the meal with their starters: Mozzarella Bites and Cheetos Poppers. The Mozzarella Bites were absolute pleasure! These golden nuggets were a sheer treat, crispy on the exterior and filled with molten, almost elastic cheese that oozed out as soon as you bit into them. And when dipped in their spicy, tangy sauce, they're finger-licking good! A post shared by MELT (@meltpk)  Similarly, the Cheetos Poppers, which resembled rocks of ruby in a little tub from a distance, were a revelation. Soft, tender chunks of chicken coated with blazing red crushed Cheetos, dip them into the spicy sauce and they can be devoured in numbers. A post shared by MELT (@meltpk)  What was supposed to be an appetizer, turned into a mini meal; they were THAT good! Up next were the main entrées, so to say, for which we ordered three kinds of beef burgers and loaded fries. The Smokey Dokey is a classic beef cheese burger topped with thick, crispy, crunchy onion rings, melted mortadella cheese and a dollop of an inhouse smokey sauce. This one turns out to be a textural and flavour bonanza; the onion rings provide some sweetness and crunch, the beef some chew, and the cheese and smokey sauce with the much-needed additional zing.  The Smashroom is one for mushroom lovers, as the classic juicy beef cheeseburger is topped with caramelized onions, loads of delicious mushroom chunks and a creamy, peppery mushroom sauce.  The third burger we tried was the Fiery Sriracha: a juicy cheeseburger, topped with caramelized onions and what was supposed to be a “fiery” sriracha sauce. So, the burger was obviously good, but it was expected to be spicy and set the taste buds ablaze, but nothing of that sort happened. In fact, the sauce was borderline bland, which just kind of killed the overall burger; it was akin to eating a plain, classic beef burger.  The burgers are a satisfying gastronomic adventure, full of texture and flavour. What’s also exciting about these burgers is that they all let the juicy, tender minced smash beef – sandwiched between buttery brioche buns -- stand out despite the toppings and accompaniments; you can taste the meat and all other ingredients in all their individual glory. And the burgers also come in double patties for those who want an extra dose of protein. We also tried their beef and chicken loaded fries, each topped generously with chicken fillet or minced, smash beef chunks, jalapenos, melted mortadella cheese, and a mix of sauces. Their serving size easily makes them a meal on their own, also priced quite reasonably at Rs599 (chicken) and Rs699 (beef).  Their shakes are a highlight of the menu: in lotus, brownie, thick chocolate, peanut butter and banana, salt caramel flavour. They're the perfect accompaniment or even a top-off to a meal. The best part about Melt is that you can catch it in the middle of the night too to satisfy any midnight snack cravings, as they’re open till 3:30am on weekends and 3am on weekdays. But they have to step up their game, because orders take too long if you don't remind them several times."

Previously grown exclusively in Japan, this prized fruit now finds a new home in Pakistan's commercial hub. The 'Miyazaki' mango, renowned for its unique red and purple hues, is a high-value fruit fetching prices between $800 and $900 per kilogram in the international market, translating to approximately Rs250,000 to Rs300,000. Locally, the price of this luxurious mango can soar to Rs3 lakh per kg, making it a rare and elite commodity not easily accessible to the common consumer. Pakistan is already famous for its diverse and flavorful mango varieties such as Chaunsa, Sindhri, Langra, Dasheri, and Anwar Ratol.  Each of these varieties holds a special place in the global market for their unique tastes. The introduction of 'Miyazaki' mangoes adds a new dimension to Pakistan's mango production, potentially elevating the country's status in the international fruit market. A local farmer, who has successfully cultivated the 'Miyazaki' mango in Karachi, shared insights with Samaa TV's Special Correspondent. He emphasized the distinct characteristics of the 'Miyazaki' mango, noting its exceptional color, taste, and value. Although typically yellow, this mango stands out for its rare red and purple appearance. The farmer revealed that the cultivation process started on a trial basis, and the initial results have been promising. With the successful adaptation of the 'Miyazaki' mango to Karachi's climate, there is potential for broader commercial cultivation, which could revolutionize the local agricultural economy."

Every year, the holy month begins around two weeks early. This year, it will pass from the longer, hotter summer days to the shorter, colder winter days for half of the planet. Ramazan started on March 11 with fasting hours varying across different countries. The fasting hours range between 12 hours and more than 17 hours. So which countries have the shortest and the longest Ramazan, especially in the Muslim world? Shortest Ramazan fast in 2024: Muslims in Chile will face the shortest Ramazan with almost 12 hours and 44 minutes of fasting. New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa being in the Southern Hemisphere also look at a shorter fasting time between 12 to 13 hours. Longest Ramazan fast: In Europe, Muslims of Finland, Iceland and Greenland will face 17 longest fasting hours during the holy month. How to observe Ramazan where it never gets dark: Although no location is anticipating a midnight sun in Ramazan, Muslims in nations where the days are especially long during the holy month are unable to observe a fast of more than 20 hours. As the daylight varies depending on the season, fasting in the countries further from the equator tends to be longer. So what do they do? Fatwas have been proclaimed in nations where the time difference between sunset and sunrise is less than three hours, enabling citizens to observe other cities' schedules. For instance, a lot of people would observe Makkah's fasting hours in Saudi Arabia. This year the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and almost the whole Middle East will observe about 13.5 to 14 hours of fasting. African country Tunisia will face the longest fasting hours of Ramazan at 14 hours and 29 minutes. Ramazan fasting durations across the Arab world: Tunisia: The longest day was 14 hours and 29 minutes, while the shortest was 13 hours and 17 minutes.

It is only ranked above those of Iraq (101st), Syria (102nd), and Afghanistan (103rd), maintaining the same position as last year.  Pakistani and Yemeni passports grant visa-free access to 33 countries. In comparison, Iraqi passports allow travel to 31 destinations, Syrian passports offer access to 28 countries, and Afghan passports provide entry to just 26 destinations. “Afghanistan remains firmly entrenched as the world’s weakest passport, losing access to yet another destination over the past six months, leaving its citizens with access to only 26 countries visa-free — the lowest score ever recorded in history of the 19-year-old index,” a press release said.

Germany, Italy, Japan, France, and Spain are tied for second place, each allowing access to 192 destinations.

This marks a significant rise from its previous 62nd position to 9th, reflecting an impressive increase of 53 places. The press release quoted Henley & Partners CEO Dr Juerg Steffen as saying that the UAE’s “meteoric ascent” was the result of “deliberate and concerted efforts by the Emirati government to position the UAE as a global hub for business, tourism, and investment. “Our research has consistently shown a strong correlation between a country’s visa-free score and its economic prosperity.

This decision allows applicants to once again use the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) iBT test results to demonstrate their English language proficiency. Last July, the DHA temporarily halted the acceptance of TOEFL scores to conduct a thorough review. After careful consideration, TOEFL scores are now recognized as valid documentation for visa applications, effective immediately. The TOEFL is a standardized test designed to assess the English language skills of non-native speakers. It is widely accepted by universities and institutions worldwide, including those in Australia. Australian immigration requires applicants to demonstrate a certain level of English proficiency to ensure effective communication and integration into Australian life. Submitting a TOEFL score is one way to meet this requirement and strengthen a visa application. The DHA reinstated the acceptance of TOEFL scores for visa applications on May 5, 2024. Only TOEFL iBT scores obtained on or after this date will be considered valid. Australia also recognizes scores from other established English proficiency exams, such as the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), Pearson Test of English (PTE), Cambridge English (CAE), and Occupational English Test (OET) for healthcare professionals. The resumption of TOEFL acceptance streamlines visa procedures, making it easier for international students, professionals, and migrants to pursue opportunities in Australia.

Initially, employees will be charged KD 150 for a work permit, with an extra KD 300 for transferring workers between companies within the first three years of employment.

World Photography Day is not just a day to commemorate the invention of photography; it’s a celebration of the visual language that transcends borders and connects people worldwide. Photography has a unique ability to tell stories, evoke emotions, and shed light on important issues. It’s a medium that captures the essence of a moment, preserving it for generations to come. The significance of this day lies in its power to inspire and educate. World Photography Day is observed on August 19th to mark the day in 1839 when the French government announced the invention of the daguerreotype, a photographic process developed by Louis Daguerre. This invention, which followed the pioneering work of Nicéphore Niépce, revolutionized the way we capture images. The daguerreotype process reduced exposure times, making it practical for the first time to capture portraits and scenes from daily life. Over the years, photography has evolved from cumbersome, time-consuming processes to the digital age we live in today. In the 19th century, it was a novelty, and today, it’s an integral part of our daily lives."

While there are countless ways to decorate these blank spaces, the key lies in finding ideas that resonate with your taste and elevate the ambiance of your living space. Decorating your blank walls is an opportunity to infuse your home with your personality and creativity. Whether you opt for a gallery wall, nature-inspired decor, mirrors, unique shelving, or fiber art, each idea has the potential to astonish and transform your living space. The key is to embrace what resonates with you and turn your blank canvases into captivating expressions of your style and identity. In this article, we’ll explore five astonishing ideas to turn your empty walls into captivating focal points. Gallery wall extravaganza   One of the most timeless and versatile ways to adorn your walls is by creating a gallery wall. This artful arrangement can be tailored to your preferences, featuring a mix of artwork, photographs, and decorative objects. To add a touch of cohesion, frame your chosen pieces in a uniform color or style. The key is to strike a balance between symmetry and asymmetry, allowing your unique style to shine through. Consider incorporating a diverse array of items, such as vintage posters, family portraits, and quirky finds from your travels. For added flair, experiment with different frame sizes and shapes. The result will be a captivating visual journey that tells a story of your life and interests. Nature’s wall art   Bring the outdoors inside by embracing the beauty of nature as wall decor. Botanical prints, pressed flowers, or even a living plant wall can infuse your space with a sense of tranquility and natural elegance. For a simple yet astonishing touch, frame dried leaves or pressed flowers between glass panes. Alternatively, opt for larger botanical prints or posters showcasing the intricacies of leaves and flowers. Consider a vertical garden, using succulents or air plants in wall-mounted containers to create a striking living wall that requires minimal maintenance. Mirror on the wall   Mirrors are not just for vanity; they can also be a powerful decorative tool. Strategically placed mirrors can make a room appear larger and reflect light, creating an illusion of spaciousness and brightness. Consider incorporating a unique mirror with an ornate frame as a statement piece, or experiment with an arrangement of smaller mirrors in various shapes and sizes to add depth and dimension to your wall. To enhance the effect, position mirrors across from windows or other light sources to maximize the play of light. Wall-mounted shelving with a twist   Functional and stylish, wall-mounted shelves offer endless possibilities for wall decor. To add an astonishing twist, choose unconventional shelving materials and shapes. Consider installing floating wooden shelves to display a curated selection of books, art objects, and plants. Alternatively, opt for asymmetrical or geometric shelving units that serve as both storage and art. The key is to balance form and function, creating an aesthetically pleasing yet practical design element. Fiber art and tapestries   The resurgence of fiber art and tapestries offers a unique way to add texture and warmth to your walls. These handmade pieces can be customized to match your color scheme and design preferences. Choose a striking macramé wall hanging as a statement piece, or opt for a large, intricately woven tapestry that covers a substantial portion of your wall. These handmade artworks can add a touch of bohemian chic or contemporary elegance to your space, depending on your choice of design and material."

The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) issued a statement on Friday explaining that the SDS initiative, which was launched in 2018, aimed to “provide faster processing for eligible post-secondary students” and had expanded to include applicants from 14 countries, such as India. The IRCC stated that Canada’s goal is to “strengthen program integrity, address student vulnerability, and ensure equal and fair access for all applicants,” which has led to the SDS closure as of November 8. Previously, SDS allowed for faster study permit processing times with higher approval rates for qualified applicants. Going forward, applications will be processed under the regular stream. According to Naresh Chavda, the president of Globayan Immigration Corporation, the SDS program initially catered to students from India and China, then expanded to other countries, offering a simplified evaluation process for those meeting language and financial criteria along with a letter of acceptance from a Canadian institution. Under SDS, permits were processed within four weeks -- half the time taken in the regular stream -- and had a 95% approval rate. Chavda remarked, “They’ve closed a program designed to attract students, likely to limit the intake of international students.” The decision may impact student interest in Canada, potentially shifting it to other destinations. Meanwhile, IRCC set a target for study permits in 2025 at 437,000, down from 485,000 in 2024, and this stabilized number will also apply in 2026. IRCC has been implementing changes related to international students since late last year. On December 7, it announced that new study permit applications from January 2024 onward must show financial proof of CA$20,635, up from CA$10,000. Further, beginning in December 2023, designated learning institutions (DLIs) will be required to verify each applicant's acceptance letter through IRCC."

Khan, known for her successful career in the entertainment industry, confessed that despite her parents' repeated warnings, she rushed into marriage without considering the long-term consequences. “At the time, I was young, impulsive, and unaware. I married out of stubbornness and ego,” she shared candidly during the interview.

I made the decision, and I alone am responsible for it,"" she said.

""She had a dream that my marriage wouldn't work, but I didn’t pay heed to her words. I lived through fear and anxiety during that time,"" Nadia admitted. The actress emphasised that while many of her peers at the time were getting married, she did not have the experience or understanding needed to make such an important decision.

The threat allegedly came from Faizan, a resident of Raipur, Chhattisgarh. The call was made to the Bandra Police Station's landline on November 5. Following the incident, a Mumbai Police team has been dispatched to Raipur to investigate further. Indian media sources say the caller threatened to harm the Bollywood superstar if several crores weren't paid as ransom. “Bandra police station received a call threatening Shah Rukh Khan and asking for five million INR. An offence has been registered. No arrest has been made yet,” a senior police official said. A case has been filed against an unidentified individual at Bandra Police Station under sections 308(4) and 351(3)(4) BNS. Details of the case are still awaited. Shah Rukh Khan has been under heightened security for some time, particularly after receiving death threats in 2023 following the success of his films 'Pathaan' and 'Jawan'. In October 2023, he was granted Y+ security, and his protection has been a priority ever since. It was reported that Shah Rukh opted not to greet fans outside his Mumbai residence, Mannat, on his birthday this year due to security concerns, though his team did not confirm or deny the rumors. The actor has not yet publicly commented on the recent death threat. Shah Rukh is not the only Bollywood star facing such threats. His close friend, Salman Khan, has also been targeted by threats, particularly in relation to his involvement in the blackbuck poaching case. Recently, Salman received a death threat from gangster Lawrence Bishnoi's gang, prompting an increase in his security. Salman has been provided Y+ security as well. These threats come in the wake of the murder of political leader Baba Siddique, for which a member of Lawrence Bishnoi's gang claimed responsibility. The gang also issued threats against Salman Khan in the same statement. Both stars, along with the Mumbai Police, are taking extra precautions to ensure their safety."

The campaign, featuring mannequins draped in plastic resembling body bags amidst a set of rubble and broken walls, sparked fury on social media, with many accusing the brand of insensitivity and even profiteering from suffering. Addressing the controversy on Tuesday, Zara, owned by Spain's Inditex -- the world's biggest fashion retailer, denied the claims, but nonetheless removed the controversial images from its website. ""Unfortunately, some customers felt offended by these images, which have now been removed, and saw in them something far from what was intended when they were created,"" said a statement published online. Facing Boycott Calls, Zara Pulls Images The controversial images depicted an anaemic-looking model carrying a plastic-wrapped figure over her shoulder in one scene, while another showed the shrouded form lying at her feet on a set featuring chunks of rubble, broken walls and other signs of destruction. These visuals triggered immediate outrage, with comparisons drawn to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, where Israel's military campaign has caused widespread devastation. Social Media Erupts in Anger The backlash on social media was swift and fierce. Platforms like X, formerly Twitter, saw a flood of angry messages, including one that superimposed a picture of a Gazan mother mourning the loss of her child with a similar white shroud, alongside calls for a complete boycott of the brand. Zara Apologizes, Claims Misunderstanding In response to the mounting criticism, Zara issued a statement acknowledging the offence caused and announcing the removal of the controversial images. However, the brand maintained that the campaign ""was conceived in July and photographed in September"", months prior to the Gaza conflict and aimed to showcase its garments in an artistic setting. A post shared by ZARA Official (@zara)  ""The idea was to present a series of images of unfinished sculptures in a sculptor's studio and was created with the sole purpose of showcasing craft-made garments in an artistic context,"" the statement added. Zara further expressed regret for the ""misunderstanding"" and reiterated its commitment to respectful practices. Context of the Gaza Conflict The controversy surrounding Zara's ad campaign unfolded against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The war began in October with Hamas launching attacks into southern Israel, resulting in significant casualties on both sides. Israel responded with a retaliatory military offensive that has caused immense damage and civilian casualties in Gaza. At the start of the war, Inditex said it was temporarily closing its 84 Zara shops in Israel until further notice."

The court, comprising Justices BP Colabawalla and Firdosh Pooniwalla, stated that it could not issue directives due to a prior order by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, which instructed the CBFC to address objections before certifying the film. The bench emphasized that issuing any relief would contradict the Madhya Pradesh High Court's directive, which would improperly compel the CBFC to disregard another court's ruling. The Bombay High Court has directed the CBFC to review the objections raised against the film and finalize the certification by September 18. The next hearing on the matter is scheduled for September 19. This decision follows a recent appeal by Zee Entertainment Enterprises, a co-producer of 'Emergency', which sought the film's release and a censor certificate. The petition argued that the CBFC had arbitrarily withheld the certificate despite its readiness. Earlier, the Madhya Pradesh High Court had addressed petitions from Sikh groups alleging that the film contains scenes that could offend their religious sentiments and potentially incite unrest. Consequently, the court instructed the CBFC to consider these objections before issuing the film's certification. As a result of these controversies, the film's release, initially set for September 6, has been postponed indefinitely. The film, directed and co-produced by Kangana Ranaut, who also stars as former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, has faced backlash from Sikh organizations, including the Shiromani Akali Dal, for allegedly misrepresenting historical facts."

The story of the film is meant to create awareness on human rights (child labour) in Pakistan. The film is directed by 20-year-old illustrator and animator Awais Shaukat, who is an undergraduate student of fine arts at the National College of Arts, Lahore. The film is being produced by Rafhan Shaukat through his Lahore-based animation studio, Awartsy Animations. The original story is based on real-life events of hundreds and thousands of children working on brick kilns, written by Awais and his team after visiting many kilns and hearing different stories from different families. “Whenever we went to a kiln, children were working there, but they always disappeared seeing us. Everybody was scared thinking we were from any government sector.”, he said. “I think animation is the only way in which you can put life into a story with a pencil that only a few people can see."" He also mentioned, “Pakistan has a rich and hard-working culture in the art, but animation is not one of them. While we are entering various digital fields, why are most artists not stepping into it in this modern era?” The film will follow the traditional way of 2D animation from the 20th century, like classic animations by Walt Disney and DreamWorks. In this animation process, artists draw every frame by hand and paint every background scene one by one. As one second includes 24 frames per second, it is always a lot of work. The film is in the pre-production stage and the team is working on the storyboard. Almost all of the conceptual design, including character designing, location designing, and the script has been completed."

The 19-year-old man, who has North Macedonian roots, made a full confession in custody, Austria's general director for public security Franz Ruf told a news conference. He swore allegiance to the IS group's leader on the internet and had chemicals, machetes and technical devices at his home in the town of Ternitz in preparation for an attack, Ruf added. The suspect was planning a lethal assault among the estimated 20,000 ""Swiftie"" fans set to gather outside Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadium, said national intelligence head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner. Two other Austrian youths aged 17 and 15 were detained on Wednesday over the reported plot. ""The main perpetrator has confessed that he was supposed to carry out a suicide attack with two accomplices,"" said Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. ""The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans ... to leave a bloodbath in their wake.""Authorities painted a picture of the main suspect having self-radicalised, transforming his appearance and sharing Islamist propaganda online. He quit his job on July 25, telling people he had ""big plans"", Ruf said. One neighbour told Austrian broadcaster Puls24 that the suspect had kept himself to himself and had grown a ""Taliban beard"". The 17-year-old suspect had been given a job with a company a few days ago that was providing services at the stadium, according to security officials. Event organiser Barracuda Music said it had cancelled Swift's three concerts in Vienna, due to start on Thursday for a sold-out 65,000 audience each, in coordination with the singer's management team. Fans, many of whom had travelled a long way to Vienna, expressed both dismay and understanding. ""It's just heartbreaking, just frustrating. But at the end of the day I guess it's for everyone's safety,"" said Mark del Rosario, who had flown from the Philippines to see the wildly popular U.S. singer. U.S. broadcaster ABC cited law enforcement and intelligence sources as saying Austrian authorities had received information about the Swift concert threat from U.S. intelligence. It quoted the sources as saying that at least one of the suspects had pledged allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent wing of IS, on Telegram in June, though the plot was IS-inspired rather than directed by the group's operatives. Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said foreign intelligence agencies had helped with the investigation, as Austrian law does not allow monitoring of messenger apps. Event organiser Live Nation urged fans of Coldplay, which is due to play at the same stadium on Aug. 21, to stay calm and said it was in contact with authorities. It did not comment on whether the show would take place. British police said on Thursday, there was nothing to indicate that the planned attack in Vienna would have an impact on Swift's shows at Wembley Stadium in London next week. ""Concerts are often a preferred target of Islamist attackers, large concerts,"" said Karner, listing the 2015 attack on the Bataclan venue in Paris and the 2017 bombing at England's Manchester Arena where U.S. pop star Ariana Grande had played. The plot in Austria also brought to mind a foiled plan by three IS-linked suspects to attack Vienna's gay pride parade last year. Islamic State was largely crushed by a U.S.-led coalition several years ago after establishing a ""caliphate"" in large areas of Iraq and Syria, but has still managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild and reinvent itself. This week's shows were to be part of the record-breaking Eras Tour by American singer-songwriter Swift which started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, and is set to conclude on Dec. 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada. Swift, 34, has not yet commented on the cancellations on her official Instagram account, which has 283 million followers. Her fans were horrified at the threat, with some begging organisers to postpone the concert instead of cancelling it outright. Promoters have said they will pay back tickets."

On Sunday evening, Jin undertook the prestigious role of torch-bearer near the esteemed Louvre Museum, marking a poignant occasion following his recent completion of mandatory military service in South Korea. Jin's arrival in Paris earlier in the week, had sparked an upsurge of anticipation among fans globally. Supporters, affectionately known as the BTS ARMY, gathered in throngs along the historic streets adjacent to the Louvre, displaying heartfelt expressions of admiration and encouragement for the artist. Supporters displayed handwritten Korean signs that read, ""Welcome, Seok-jin, I Love You,"" ""Go, Seok-jin,"" and ""Best wishes, Seok-jin,"" accompanied by Korean national flags. Jin, sporting a timid smile, reciprocated the affection of his fans by waving to them, acknowledging their unwavering love and support.

The relocation from Gulberg's Main Boulevard hasn't just shifted its physical space but also upgraded its interior ambiance. The cafe-style setting, adorned in soothing shades of pink and white, exudes a charming vibe. Adorning the walls with photographs of renowned chefs adds an inspirational touch to the atmosphere, creating a welcoming environment for patrons seeking a delightful dining experience.  We were recently invited to a tasting of the chef’s specials. Every day, The Fig Tree has a couple of special items on offer, including soups and starters, mains and a dessert -- besides the regular menu. So, if you’re lucky, you might just be able to grab one of these on the day you visit. Kicking off the culinary journey with a refreshing blend of pomegranate, salt, apple, and soda sets the tone for an intriguing gastronomic adventure. The combination offers a tantalizing mix of flavors, balancing sweetness with a hint of tanginess, while the fizz adds a playful element to the palate. Potato and Cauliflower Soup with Turkey Bacon Served with crispy garlic bread, this warm and comforting soup tantalizes the taste buds with every spoonful.  While slightly runny in consistency, the melding of potato chunks, cauliflower, and crispy turkey bacon creates a harmonious flavor profile, perfect for soothing the senses on a chilly day. Beetroot and Beef Salad An ensemble of rocket leaves, pomegranate molasses-infused apple slices, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, cream, cheese, pumpkin seeds, raw beef rolls, and beetroot promises a symphony of flavors and textures.  However, the dish falls short in execution, with beetroot slices needing a softer texture, the radishes probably sliced or cubed instead of cut in half and placed on the plate and the just so much crunch in the dish overwhelming the balance. Despite the mishap, the creativity in ingredient pairing shines through, offering glimpses of culinary innovation. Beef with Tangy Onion and Pomegranate Sauce While the meat is cooked to a perfect medium rare, the dish is bland. It also lacks the punch expected from the tangy onion and pomegranate sauce, which wasn’t tangy and didn’t complement the beef. The absence of seasoning leaves the palate yearning for depth, though the well-executed meat texture adds a redeeming quality to the overall experience.  Red Snapper with Sweet and Spicy Orange Sauce A standout among the main courses, the vibrant plate features tender red snapper adorned with a luscious sweet and spicy orange sauce. The sauce is so good you could wipe the container clean with a spoon.  The harmonious blend of flavors tantalizes the taste buds, with the creamy spinach adding a luxurious touch to each bite. A dish that truly satisfies the craving for a memorable culinary experience. Chocolate Mousse with Orange Panna Cotta Cream and Spiced FruitEnding on a sweet note, the chocolate mousse, enveloped in orange panna cotta cream and topped with spiced fruit, offers a decadent finale to the meal.  While creamy and indulgent, the dessert lacks textural contrast, missing a crunchy element to elevate the experience. Nonetheless, it provides a satisfying conclusion to the culinary journey at The Fig Tree Cafe and Restaurant. The Fig Tree Cafe and Restaurant presents a mixed bag of culinary delights, with hits and misses across the menu. While some dishes shine with inventive flavors and impeccable execution, others fall short in terms of balance and seasoning.  Nevertheless, what has to be appreciated is the effort at innovation and the planning behind each combination, the charming ambiance and diverse menu offerings that cater to a wide range of palates. It aims to promise a dining experience that is both memorable and satisfying."

Dr. Francl, a chemistry professor at Bryn Mawr College, suggests adding a pinch of salt to tea to reduce bitterness and adding warmed milk after pouring to prevent curdling. She recommends using a short, stout mug and opting for tea leaves over teabags. Dr. Francl also suggests adding a small squeeze of lemon juice to eliminate scum, and removing the lid when drinking from a takeaway cup for a better aroma. Dr. Francl, in her book 'Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea,' claims to have derived this recipe from analysing numerous research papers and ancient texts spanning over 1,000 years. Her unconventional tea-making method has ignited discussions on cultural differences and tea habits between the US and the UK. The US embassy in London distanced itself from the claims, emphasizing that adding salt to Britain's national drink is not official US policy. The professor, a tea enthusiast, explains her findings, stating that her goal is to make the very best cup of tea. She criticizes the quality of tea in the US, emphasizing her preference for tea over coffee. Dr. Francl's suggestions include using a specific mug, choosing leaves over teabags, and addressing issues like bitterness and scum.

The store, located in the capital city of Riyadh, will implement a registration process through an app, requiring customers to obtain permission from the foreign ministry and adhere to monthly quotas. Although situated in Riyadh's diplomatic quarter, it remains uncertain if the store will extend its services to non-Muslim expatriates. This development aligns with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's efforts to modernize Saudi Arabia's image. The country, known for its ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam, has seen recent liberalization measures, including the relaxation of laws restricting women, such as lifting the ban on driving. Alcohol is strictly prohibited under Saudi law, with severe punishments, including public flogging, for violators. Despite this, a black market exists, and authorities often turn a blind eye to home brewing and alcohol consumption in expatriate compounds. Notably, Riyadh has seen the opening of bars serving non-alcoholic cocktails, and plans include making alcohol available in the beach resort of Neom, part of the ambitious Vision 2030 plan led by Crown Prince Mohammed to diversify the economy away from fossil fuels and attract foreign tourism and investment."

The impact is felt across neighbouring cities, with Rawalpindi reporting prices as high as Rs310 per kg. City-wise Price Breakdown: According to PBS data, the national average for onion prices stands at approximately Rs230 per kg. Impact of India's export ban The surge is notably linked to India's ban on onion exports in early December. With India out of the export market, Pakistan has witnessed a surge in demand, which triggered a spike in local prices. Government measures Despite governmental efforts to curb the surge, such as the recent increase in the minimum export price (MEP) from $750 to $1,200 per tonne, the local market continues to grapple with soaring onion prices."

Norway eases requirements for permanent residency","https://www.samaa.tv/2087313307-great-news-for-expats-norway-eases-requirements-for-permanent-residency","Norway has implemented new measures to facilitate the process for foreigners to obtain permanent residence, reducing the requirement period to just three years. As of April 18, the country has eliminated the financial support prerequisite previously needed to secure a permanent residence permit. Under the previous regulations, individuals aged 18 to 67 had to demonstrate a stable income and refrain from receiving government financial aid to qualify for permanent residency. However, recent amendments have lifted the ban on receiving financial assistance while maintaining the stability of income as a condition. A permanent residence permit grants individuals the privilege to reside and work in Norway indefinitely. To be eligible, applicants must hold a valid residence permit in Norway for a minimum of three years and fulfill additional criteria. Upon approval, recipients will be issued a resident card as evidence of their permanent resident status, replacing the previous practice of affixing stickers to passports. Approved sources of income to meet financial requirements include employment, business earnings, pension payments, loans, education grants, and introductory benefits. Additionally, financial aid is available for individuals facing financial hardship during their stay in Norway. This initiative aims to streamline the immigration process and foster a more welcoming environment for foreign nationals seeking to make Norway their permanent home."

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak revealed that a record-breaking 745,000 people traveled to Britain in 2022. To control the number of arrivals, the minimum salary requirements for skilled and family visas have been elevated significantly. For skilled visas, the annual salary threshold has risen from £26,200 to £38,700, while for family visas, it has increased from £18,600 to £29,000. Notably, certain sectors like health, social care, and teaching are exempt from these salary requirements. Additionally, individuals employed in the social care sector are no longer permitted to bring dependents to the UK. These policy changes came into effect on April 11. What are the rules about family visas? Regarding family visas, individuals seeking to reside with relatives who have been granted permission to stay in the UK for over six months must obtain a family visa. Approximately 82,395 family visas were issued by September 2023, allowing individuals to reunite with their spouses, fiancés, children, parents, or other eligible relatives. New UK Student Visa Rules In terms of student visas, the UK government granted a total of 486,107 student visas between September 2022 and September 2023, with a significant portion awarded to citizens of India, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the United States. Postgraduate students are now eligible to apply for visas for their spouses or children under the age of 18. However, starting from January 2024, international postgraduate students will only be able to bring family members if they are part of a research program. Furthermore, graduates who have completed their degrees can remain in the UK for up to two years (or three years for doctoral degree holders) under a graduate visa to pursue employment opportunities."

The new regulations include English language requirements and a reduced maximum stay for low-skilled workers, from five years to three. These changes aim to address concerns about inflation due to migration and ensure that only skilled migrants are granted entry. Under the tightened rules, applicants for most work visas must meet minimum skill thresholds and demonstrate relevant work experience. Employers are now responsible for ensuring that migrants meet these requirements before offering them a job. Additionally, plans to fast-track residency for certain occupations, such as welders and fitters, have been scrapped. According to Immigration Minister Erica Stanford, these measures are part of a broader effort to create a smarter immigration system and prevent the exploitation of migrant workers. The government is prioritizing attracting highly skilled migrants, particularly in fields with shortages like secondary teaching. However, concerns have been raised about the potential unintended consequences of the new rules. Some worry that making it harder for motivated workers to enter New Zealand could hurt businesses and the economy. Others point out that while migration levels have been high, many New Zealanders are also leaving the country, often for Australia. As New Zealand grapples with balancing migration levels and economic needs, policymakers are working to strike the right balance between attracting skilled migrants and addressing domestic concerns about inflation and housing affordability."

This decision aims to address concerns regarding the quality of post-secondary education and protect international students from exploitation by questionable institutions. British Columbia hosts a considerable number of Indian students, enrolled in prestigious institutions such as the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, and the University of Victoria. However, recent measures by the provincial government indicate a shift towards stricter regulations in the education sector. The province plans to introduce minimum language score requirements at private educational institutions and raise standards for labor market prerequisites and degrees. These changes underscore the government's commitment to enhancing educational standards and safeguarding the interests of international students. The decision aligns with broader federal initiatives aimed at managing the influx of international students in Canada. The Trudeau government has announced a two-year ban on new international student permits, targeting a reduction of enrollments by 35% to address housing shortages exacerbated by population growth. Despite Canada's goal of admitting 500,000 permanent residents and 900,000 foreign students in 2023 to drive economic growth, challenges have emerged. The country faces a housing shortfall of 345,000 units, prompting concerns about the sustainability of current immigration policies. Moreover, diplomatic tensions between Canada and India have contributed to a decline in study permits issued to Indian students, highlighting the complexities of international relations and their impact on education policies. As Canada navigates these challenges, policymakers face the formidable task of balancing economic objectives with the need to maintain high educational standards and address housing shortages. The decisions made in British Columbia and at the federal level will shape the landscape of international education and immigration in the coming years."

Consumers have labeled the Italian luxury label, renowned for its playful and food-inspired creations - including its £995 French bread leather bag, 'bonkers' for marketing the 'meticulously handcrafted' green accessory for almost £4,000. The distinctive handbag has captured the attention of retailer Aldi, with the budget supermarket choosing to challenge the luxury brand by presenting its shoppers with an economical alternative - priced at 75p. The designer piece, named the 'Sedano Bag', is crafted from nappa leather and is characterized by the brand as a 'maxi celery-shaped clutch with a digital print that has a three-dimensional effect'. The company further noted that its two-tone coloring added 'realism to the accessory' and 'its unique shape represents the symbol of Moschino's irreverent spirit'. The development appears to have motivated Aldi to venture into high fashion, despite their item lacking style and couture, yet abundant in practicality. Poking fun at Moschino, Aldi posted an image on Facebook featuring a model wearing a nude mac coat while holding a bunch of green celery sticks listed at 75p. The text stated: ""Your move Moschino, but we do have a whole veg aisle."" The model is shown wandering through the fruit and veg section while adopting various poses, and in one shot appears before displays of oranges and green apples. The photographs shared notable resemblances with the advertisement on Moschino's website - the sole distinction being the use of an actual celery-shaped bag, and naturally its substantial price tag. Moschino detailed that the leaves and branches on the bag were constructed with a wire core 'to allow their movement and create the desired volume'. The sophisticated accessory also incorporates 'digital print' which references 'the photograph of a real celery'. However customers remain skeptical and have responded to both the expensive bag and Aldi's mockery with incredulity and humor. ""Have Moschino actually lost the plot?"" wrote one person. Another remarked: ""Brilliant as always Aldi! [I] think Moschino have taken leaf of their senses"". Doubting its reality, someone else commented: ""lol I had to look! Didn't believe it! But it's true!"" Meanwhile one individual questioned: ""Who would actually buy a celery bag?"" Elsewhere, a shopper on Reddit quipped: ""Where would you wear these? At the farmers market?"" Another stated: ""I might as well use what's in my fridge and go outside"" and a third declared: ""I think it's rich people cosplaying regular people who do things like buying groceries lol""."
"989","Entertainment","Will a curfew ease overtourism in Seoul's historic Hanok Village?","https://www.samaa.tv/2087323166-will-a-curfew-ease-overtourism-in-seoul-s-historic-hanok-village","Kwon Young-doo, owner of a private art gallery in Seoul's historic Bukchon Hanok Village, is concerned about an impending curfew policy aimed at mitigating overtourism in the area. The curfew, set for a trial in November and to be officially launched in March next year, will limit tourist access to specific areas of Bukchon from 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) to 10 a.m. Fines of up to 100,000 won ($72) will be imposed on violators. ""Who would want to visit?"" said Kwon, the owner of the Asian Cultural Art Museum, who moved to the historic area 18 years ago. ""They'll leave with a bad impression of South Korea."" Bukchon Hanok Village, with its narrow winding alleyways in hilly northern Seoul, dates back to the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897). The area has become a popular tourist destination, especially after being featured on a TV show a decade ago. Tourists and Koreans alike are drawn to the neighbourhood for its quaint houses with signature wood columns and doors, a courtyard and tiled roof. However, increased tourism has become more than an inconvenience for the residents, who complain about noise, littering, public urination and invasion of privacy. Some tourists have been caught on surveillance cameras trying to enter private homes or peeking inside without permission, generating friction with locals. Many residents have chosen to leave, leading to a 27.6% drop in the village's population over the past 10 years, according to the Jongno district office. The area attracted approximately 6 million visitors last year, compared with its resident population of around 6,100. Chung Moon-hun, the Jongno district head, says the goal is to protect the rights of residents and the restrictions will be adjusted if necessary to make it effective. The area where curfew hours and fines will be imposed is approximately 34,000 square metres, about the size of five soccer fields. But residents are sceptical about the policy's effectiveness citing loopholes such as exemptions for tourists staying overnight in hanok accommodations. They also blame the proliferation of corporate-run hanok stays for disrupting their lives. Since 2020, authorities have loosened restrictions on traditional Korean houses offering accommodation, resulting in a surge in corporate-run hanok stays in the residential areas, residents say. In 2010, 10 traditional houses were registered in Bukchon under the name Traditional Korean Housing Experience Businesses; by October 2024, that number had ballooned to 116, according to the district office. ""People come for just a day to enjoy themselves, and the noise from parties is extremely loud,"" said Kim Eun-mee, who lives next to a hanok stay. Clearing trash in front of her home has become a chore she has to tend to several times a day. ""It's often difficult to maintain a normal daily routine due to disturbances like people dragging suitcases around even during the early hours, which frequently wakes me up."" Lee Dong-woo, CEO of hanok stay booking platform BUTLER.LEE, said the business took off when owners who found it difficult to renovate or maintain old houses entrusted the property to hospitality businesses. ""These requests are driving the expansion, not because we are actively evicting current residents to operate hanok stays, which is completely untrue,"" Lee who manages 17 hanok stays in Bukchon said. Tourists, meanwhile, are divided over the curfew. Some agree the residents' quality of life is important. Others chafe at the idea of getting fined for simply walking down a public street. There are also questions about enforcement; how to tell tourists from residents, how to make foreigners pay the fine, and the language barrier."

India's media landscape, particularly the film industry has played a significant role in this initiative. Bollywood films have often misrepresented Pakistan, portraying it negatively and distorting reality to serve national interests. This approach not only furthered the Hindutva ideology but also aimed to depict Pakistan as a ""dangerous entity."" The content generated by Indian media is rife with inaccuracies and designed to incite hatred. Through the dissemination of false narratives, India seeks to manipulate global opinion in its favour while diverting attention from its internal issues by blaming Pakistan for various problems. Despite violating international laws with its own policies, India continues to project an image of Pakistan as the aggressor. The ongoing media campaigns not only promote violence but also pose a significant threat to regional peace. Furthermore, the spread of false information by Indian media has represented an irresponsible practice on a global scale. It exacerbates human rights violations, as the Indian leadership often targets Pakistan to distract from its own shortcomings. "

While some compared her to international models, others were less than impressed, with one user calling her walk ""the worst imitation of Gigi Hadid"" and another joking, “Looks like she just watched Kangana Ranaut’s Fashion.” The harshest critics went as far as labelling it a “ramp disaster,” while another remarked, “It looked like she was about to fall any moment!” Despite the backlash, Mahira continues to be celebrated for her unique charm and acting prowess, though this incident has shown that even icons aren’t exempt from social media’s sharp eye.

Produced independently by Aleem Bukhari’s Sleepbyte Films and co-produced by Australian producers Lachlan and Renee Huddy, the film dives into a world of surrealism, strangeness, and dark humour that challenges traditional storytelling.  In 'Anaari Science', the narrative follows two contrasting characters: Master Jalal, an eccentric government school teacher who spends his isolated life immersed in crafting intricate designs while fuelled by his own unusual self-brewed tea, and Hassan, a young, streetwise drifter who takes on various odd jobs and scams to survive. As the story unfolds, the film blurs the boundary between the magical and the real, connecting the lives of these characters across generational divides. The film’s title, 'Anaari Science', refers to the Urdu slang “Anaari,” meaning an individual who is ridiculous or lacks traditional sensibility. This aptly reflects the film’s tone, portraying a science that is as absurd and unpredictable as the characters navigating its world."

But no one was singing. Theatre troupe Fantasi Tuli (Deaf Fantasy) was performing Indonesia's first musical with mainly deaf artists and crew on Saturday, using screens around the stage showing dialogue and lyrics as actors performed with their facial expressions and hand signs. The musical ""Senandung Senyap"" (Songs of Silence) depicts the plight of students in a middle school for children with disabilities. Directors Hasna Mufidah and Helga Theresia created it to raise awareness and promote the use of sign language. ""My hope is, going forward, inclusivity can be strengthened, that between deaf and hearing people, hearing is not superior - we're equal,"" Mufidah, who is deaf, said through Indonesian sign language. Involving more than 60 deaf actors and crew, aged 16 to 40, the musical took three months to prepare. It is inspired by Deaf West Theatre in the United States, Helga said. The performance examines special-needs education in Indonesian schools, where deaf students are often taught with an emphasis on speech training and lip-reading, more than on sign language, amid a wider debate about the best education methods for children with hearing disability. Some in the deaf community argue oral education can lead to a sense of alienation, and that sign language is a more natural way to communicate for them. Proponents of such a method say it could better integrate people with hearing disability with the more dominant hearing community. For deaf actor Hanna Aretha Oktavia, the musical was her introduction to sign language and the wider deaf community. ""Throughout dialogue rehearsals we had to use as much expressions as possible and to follow the storyline,"" Hanna said. ""What's interesting is in rehearsals we have to feel the tempo and vibrations and match them with the choreography. I think that's the most intriguing part because I love to dance. And we paid close attention to the beats with the help of hearing aids. We use big speakers to help guide us,"" she said. More than 2 million of Indonesia's 280 million people have a hearing disability, including 27,983 students in special-needs schools."

Following the incident, a Mumbai Police team has been dispatched to Raipur to investigate further. Indian media sources say the caller threatened to harm the Bollywood superstar if several crores weren't paid as ransom. “Bandra police station received a call threatening Shah Rukh Khan and asking for five million INR.

A case has been filed against an unidentified individual at Bandra Police Station under sections 308(4) and 351(3)(4) BNS. Details of the case are still awaited. Shah Rukh Khan has been under heightened security for some time, particularly after receiving death threats in 2023 following the success of his films 'Pathaan' and 'Jawan'.
