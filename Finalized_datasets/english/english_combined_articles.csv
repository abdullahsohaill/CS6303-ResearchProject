The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) has submitted an application to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) seeking the reduction in electricity prices for October. The application, filed for the October fuel price adjustment, highlights that the cost of electricity generation was significantly lower than initially estimated. NEPRA is set to hold a hearing on the application on November 26, where the final decision will be made. The CPPA reported that 9.98 billion units of electricity were sold in October. The fuel cost per unit of electricity generation was recorded at Rs9.26, significantly lower than the estimated Rs10.27 per unit. This reduction in fuel costs is the main factor behind the proposed decrease in electricity prices. The decision will not apply to customers of K-Electric. The reduction in electricity prices comes as a relief to consumers amid rising costs of living, with hopes that it will alleviate some of the financial pressure on households and businesses across the country."

According to documents from the Ministry of Petroleum, providing LNG to domestic consumers will require an investment of Rs163 billion. Sources said that the imported LNG is increasing pressure on pipelines on a daily basis. Sources confirmed that the power sector had been using 600 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of LNG. With the closure of captive power plants, 150MMcfd of LNG will now become surplus, while the gas sector is also earning a revenue of Rs400 billion from captive power.  The government plans to address the circular debt issue by increasing gas tariffs and removing the tariff difference between imported LNG and local gas. Currently, the tariff for local gas is set at Rs1,550 per MMcfd, while the tariff for imported LNG is Rs3,500 per MMcfd. By eliminating this tariff disparity, the government expects to generate Rs200 billion in revenue. Additionally, the tariff for fertilizer companies will also be increased as part of the broader plan to boost government revenue. The new gas tariffs are scheduled to come into effect in February 2025."

During a 3.5 hour window that opens at 4:35am EST (0935GMT), a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 23 Starlink spacecraft, including 12 with direct-to-smartphone capability, has been scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Monday, reportedSpace.com. About eight minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9s first stage will return to Earth, touching down on the droneship, if all goes according to plan. Notably, for this particular booster, it will be the 13th launch and landing, according to a SpaceX mission description. Moreover, six of its 12 flights to date have been Starlink missions. Upper stage of the Falcon 9 will continue hauling the 23 Starlink satellites to low Earth orbit. Additionally, about 65 minutes after liftoff, it's scheduled to deploy them there. According to satellite tracker and astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, Starlink is the largest satellite constellation ever built, consisting of more than 6,600 active spacecraft. In 2024, SpaceX has conducted 115 Falcon 9 missions so far and nearly 70% of them have been Starlink flights."

Singh said that ""shortly before the pyre was to be lit, Rohitash's body started movements"", adding that ""he was alive and was breathing"". Kumar was rushed to hospital for a second time, but was confirmed dead on Friday during treatment.
