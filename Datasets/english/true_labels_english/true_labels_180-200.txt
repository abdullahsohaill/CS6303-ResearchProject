In some good news, the price of electricity is likely to become cheap by Rs1.1 per unit for a month. The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) has submitted an application to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) seeking the reduction in electricity prices for October. The application, filed for the October fuel price adjustment, highlights that the cost of electricity generation was significantly lower than initially estimated. NEPRA is set to hold a hearing on the application on November 26, where the final decision will be made. The CPPA reported that 9.98 billion units of electricity were sold in October. The fuel cost per unit of electricity generation was recorded at Rs9.26, significantly lower than the estimated Rs10.27 per unit. This reduction in fuel costs is the main factor behind the proposed decrease in electricity prices. The decision will not apply to customers of K-Electric. The reduction in electricity prices comes as a relief to consumers amid rising costs of living, with hopes that it will alleviate some of the financial pressure on households and businesses across the country.

Pakistan has decided to stop the purchase of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and redirect it to domestic consumers, following a reduction in electricity consumption. According to documents from the Ministry of Petroleum, providing LNG to domestic consumers will require an investment of Rs163 billion. Sources said that the imported LNG is increasing pressure on pipelines on a daily basis. Sources confirmed that the power sector had been using 600 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of LNG. With the closure of captive power plants, 150MMcfd of LNG will now become surplus, while the gas sector is also earning a revenue of Rs400 billion from captive power.  The government plans to address the circular debt issue by increasing gas tariffs and removing the tariff difference between imported LNG and local gas. Currently, the tariff for local gas is set at Rs1,550 per MMcfd, while the tariff for imported LNG is Rs3,500 per MMcfd. By eliminating this tariff disparity, the government expects to generate Rs200 billion in revenue. Additionally, the tariff for fertilizer companies will also be increased as part of the broader plan to boost government revenue. The new gas tariffs are scheduled to come into effect in February 2025.

Overseas Pakistanis have broken previous records by sending home $11.8 billion in the first four months of the current fiscal year, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan. The inflows represent a major 35% year-on-year growth of four months. The month of October alone saw the highest monthly remittance in Pakistan's history, with expatriates sending $3.05 billion -- an increase of 7% compared to the previous month and 24% higher than the same month last year. According to the SBP data of monthly and four-month workers' remittances, the contributions from overseas Pakistanis in just four months surpassed the funds received from international institutions like the IMF and World Bank.

In terms of country-wise contributions, Pakistanis residing in Saudi Arabia led with $770 million remitted in October, followed by $620 million from the UAE and $430 million from the United Kingdom. Experts believe this record surge in remittances will continue to positively impact the national economy, easing pressures on the country's current account and contributing to currency stability amidst volatile market conditions.

YouTube Music, Google's music streaming service, is reportedly testing a redesigned user interface for its "Now Playing" screen, aiming to improve user experience. This update follows the recent introduction of the "Speed Dial" feature, which replaced the "Listen Again" section last month, allowing quicker access to favorite tracks. The changes were first highlighted by a Reddit user, u/Jumfrov, and later reported by 9to5Google. In the redesigned UI, key controls such as shuffle, rewind, play/pause, next, and repeat buttons have been relocated beneath the song title. Secondary buttons for actions like liking, disliking, saving, commenting, and sharing have been shifted to the bottom of the screen. Notably, the seek bar has also undergone a subtle modification.

Other elements of the Now Playing interface remain unchanged. However, the update has not yet been rolled out universally, with only select users reporting the changes. It remains unclear whether this redesigned UI will be introduced on a larger scale or if YouTube Music will revert to the previous layout.

Brazil's First Lady Rosangela da Silva publicly insulted billionaire Elon Musk, owner of X (formerly Twitter), calling for stricter regulation of social media in a fiery moment during a pre-G20 summit event on Saturday. Speaking on a panel about combating disinformation, Janja was startled by a loud noise, prompting her to quip, "I think it's Elon Musk." She then added, "I'm not afraid of you, Elon Musk [hurling foul language at Musk]." A video of the remark quickly gained traction on X, prompting Musk to respond with a sharp rebuke.
